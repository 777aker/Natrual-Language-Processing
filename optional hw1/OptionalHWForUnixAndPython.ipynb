      "part of the public. She was so used to hearing Sellers lash the\n",
      "Philistine and hold forth on unappreciated merit that she could hardly\n",
      "believe the miracle when, in answer to a sympathetic bromide on the\n",
      "popular lack of taste in Art, Beverley replied that, as far as he was\n",
      "concerned, the public showed strong good sense. If he had been striving\n",
      "with every nerve to win her esteem, he could not have done it more\n",
      "surely than with that one remark. Though she invariably listened with a\n",
      "sweet patience which encouraged them to continue long after the point\n",
      "at which she had begun in spirit to throw things at them, Annette had\n",
      "no sympathy with men who whined. She herself was a fighter. She hated\n",
      "as much as anyone the sickening blows which Fate hands out to the\n",
      "struggling and ambitious; but she never made them the basis of a\n",
      "monologue act. Often, after a dreary trip round the offices of the\n",
      "music-publishers, she would howl bitterly in secret, and even gnaw her\n",
      "pillow in the watches of the night; but in public her pride kept her\n",
      "unvaryingly bright and cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, for the first time, she revealed something of her woes. There\n",
      "was that about the mop-headed young man which invited confidences. She\n",
      "told him of the stony-heartedness of music-publishers, of the\n",
      "difficulty of getting songs printed unless you paid for them, of their\n",
      "wretched sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But those songs you've been playing,' said Beverley, 'they've been\n",
      "published?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, those three. But they are the only ones.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And didn't they sell?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hardly at all. You see, a song doesn't sell unless somebody well known\n",
      "sings it. And people promise to sing them, and then don't keep their\n",
      "word. You can't depend on what they say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give me their names,' said Beverley, 'and I'll go round tomorrow and\n",
      "shoot the whole lot. But can't you do anything?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only keep on keeping on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish,' he said, 'that any time you're feeling blue about things you\n",
      "would come up and pour out the poison on me. It's no good bottling it\n",
      "up. Come up and tell me about it, and you'll feel ever so much better.\n",
      "Or let me come down. Any time things aren't going right just knock on\n",
      "the ceiling.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so\n",
      "sensitive as a reformed floor-knocker. You will come up or let me come\n",
      "down, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out\n",
      "and kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only thing\n",
      "for you to do is to knock on the ceiling. Then I'll come charging down\n",
      "and see if there's anything I can do to help.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You'll be sorry you ever said this.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I won't,' he said stoutly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you really mean it, it _would_ be a relief,' she admitted.\n",
      "'Sometimes I'd give all the money I'm ever likely to make for someone\n",
      "to shriek my grievances at. I always think it must have been so nice\n",
      "for the people in the old novels, when they used to say: \"Sit down and\n",
      "I will tell you the story of my life.\" Mustn't it have been heavenly?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well,' said Beverley, rising, 'you know where I am if I'm wanted.\n",
      "Right up there where the knocking came from.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Knocking?' said Annette. 'I remember no knocking.'\n",

      "\n",
      "A particularly maddening hour with one of her pupils drove her up the\n",
      "very next day. Her pupils were at once her salvation and her despair.\n",
      "They gave her the means of supporting life, but they made life hardly\n",
      "worth supporting. Some of them were learning the piano. Others thought\n",
      "they sang. All had solid ivory skulls. There was about a teaspoonful of\n",
      "grey matter distributed among the entire squad, and the pupil Annette\n",
      "had been teaching that afternoon had come in at the tail-end of the\n",
      "division.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the studio with Beverley she found Reginald Sellers, standing in a\n",
      "critical attitude before the easel. She was not very fond of him. He\n",
      "was a long, offensive, patronizing person, with a moustache that looked\n",
      "like a smear of charcoal, and a habit of addressing her as 'Ah, little\n",
      "one!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley looked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you brought your hatchet, Miss Brougham? If you have, you're just\n",
      "in time to join in the massacre of the innocents. Sellers has been\n",
      "smiting my child and cat hip and thigh. Look at his eye. There! Did you\n",
      "see it flash then? He's on the warpath again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My dear Beverley,' said Sellers, rather stiffly, 'I am merely\n",
      "endeavouring to give you my idea of the picture's defects. I am sorry\n",
      "if my criticism has to be a little harsh.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Go right on,' said Beverley, cordially. 'Don't mind me; it's all for\n",
      "my good.'\n",
      "\n",

      "no--no--er--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That kind of cat wouldn't,' said Beverley. 'It isn't that breed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think it's a dear cat,' said Annette. She felt her temper, always\n",
      "quick, getting the better of her. She knew just how incompetent\n",
      "Sellers was, and it irritated her beyond endurance to see Beverley's\n",
      "good-humoured acceptance of his patronage.\n",
      "\n",
      "'At any rate,' said Beverley, with a grin, 'you both seem to recognize\n",
      "that it is a cat. You're solid on that point, and that's something,\n",
      "seeing I'm only a beginner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know, my dear fellow; I know,' said Sellers, graciously. 'You\n",
      "mustn't let my criticism discourage you. Don't think that your work\n",
      "lacks promise. Far from it. I am sure that in time you will do very\n",
      "well indeed. Quite well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A cold glitter might have been observed in Annette's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Sellers,' she said, smoothly, 'had to work very hard himself before\n",
      "he reached his present position. You know his work, of course?'\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time Beverley seemed somewhat confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I--er--why--' he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, but of course you do,' she went on, sweetly. 'It's in all the\n",
      "magazines.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley looked at the great man with admiration, and saw that he had\n",
      "flushed uncomfortably. He put this down to the modesty of genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "'In the advertisement pages,' said Annette. 'Mr Sellers drew that\n",
      "picture of the Waukeesy Shoe and the Restawhile Settee and the tin of\n",
      "sardines in the Little Gem Sardine advertisement. He is very good at\n",
      "still life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a tense silence. Beverley could almost hear the voice of the\n",
      "referee uttering the count.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Miss Brougham,' said Sellers at last, spitting out the words, 'has\n",
      "confined herself to the purely commercial side of my work. There is\n",
      "another.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, of course there is. You sold a landscape for five pounds only\n",
      "eight months ago, didn't you? And another three months before that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was enough. Sellers bowed stiffly and stalked from the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley picked up a duster and began slowly to sweep the floor with\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you doing?' demanded Annette, in a choking voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The fragments of the wretched man,' whispered Beverley. 'They must be\n",
      "swept up and decently interred. You certainly have got the punch, Miss\n",
      "Brougham.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He dropped the duster with a startled exclamation, for Annette had\n",
      "suddenly burst into a flood of tears. With her face buried in her hands\n",
      "she sat in her chair and sobbed desperately.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a cat! I'm a beast! I hate myself!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a pig! I'm a fiend!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We're all struggling and trying to get on and having hard luck, and\n",
      "instead of doing what I can to help, I go and t-t-taunt him with not\n",
      "being able to sell his pictures! I'm not fit to live! _Oh!_'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of gulping sobs followed, diminishing by degrees into silence.\n",
      "Presently she looked up and smiled, a moist and pathetic smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm sorry,' she said, 'for being so stupid. But he was so horrid and\n",
      "patronizing to you, I couldn't help scratching. I believe I'm the worst\n",
      "cat in London.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, this is,' said Beverley, pointing to the canvas. 'At least,\n",
      "according to the late Sellers. But, I say, tell me, isn't the deceased\n",
      "a great artist, then? He came curveting in here with his chest out and\n",
      "started to slate my masterpiece, so I naturally said, \"What-ho! 'Tis a\n",
      "genius!\" Isn't he?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He can't sell his pictures anywhere. He lives on the little he can get\n",
      "from illustrating advertisements. And I t-taunt--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'_Please!_' said Beverley, apprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "She recovered herself with a gulp.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't help it,' she said, miserably. 'I rubbed it in. Oh, it was\n",
      "hateful of me! But I was all on edge from teaching one of my awful\n",
      "pupils, and when he started to patronize you--'\n",
      "\n",
      "She blinked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Poor devil!' said Beverley. 'I never guessed. Good Lord!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I must go and tell him I'm sorry,' she said. 'He'll snub me horribly,\n",
      "but I must.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She went out. Beverley lit a pipe and stood at the window looking\n",
      "thoughtfully down into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people\n",
      "do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of\n",
      "them. Sellers belonged to the latter class. When Annette, meek,\n",
      "penitent, with all her claws sheathed, came to him and grovelled, he\n",
      "forgave her with a repulsive magnanimity which in a less subdued mood\n",
      "would have stung her to renewed pugnacity. As it was, she allowed\n",
      "herself to be forgiven, and retired with a dismal conviction that from\n",
      "now on he would be more insufferable than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her surmise proved absolutely correct. His visits to the newcomer's\n",
      "studio began again, and Beverley's picture, now nearing completion,\n",
      "came in for criticism enough to have filled a volume. The good humour\n",
      "with which he received it amazed Annette. She had no proprietary\n",
      "interest in the painting beyond what she acquired from a growing regard\n",
      "for its parent (which disturbed her a good deal when she had time to\n",
      "think of it); but there were moments when only the recollection of her\n",
      "remorse for her previous outbreak kept her from rending the critic.\n",
      "Beverley, however, appeared to have no artistic sensitiveness\n",
      "whatsoever. When Sellers savaged the cat in a manner which should have\n",
      "brought the S.P.C.A. down upon him, Beverley merely beamed. His\n",
      "long-sufferingness was beyond Annette's comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began to admire him for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make his position as critic still more impregnable, Sellers was now\n",
      "able to speak as one having authority. After years of floundering, his\n",
      "luck seemed at last to have turned. His pictures, which for months had\n",
      "lain at an agent's, careened like crippled battleships, had at length\n",
      "begun to find a market. Within the past two weeks three landscapes and\n",
      "an allegorical painting had sold for good prices; and under the\n",
      "influence of success he expanded like an opening floweret. When\n",
      "Epstein, the agent, wrote to say that the allegory had been purchased\n",
      "by a Glasgow plutocrat of the name of Bates for one hundred and sixty\n",
      "guineas, Sellers' views on Philistines and their crass materialism and\n",
      "lack of taste underwent a marked modification. He spoke with some\n",
      "friendliness of the man Bates.\n",
      "\n",
      "'To me,' said Beverley, when informed of the event by Annette, 'the\n",
      "matter has a deeper significance. It proves that Glasgow has at last\n",
      "produced a sober man. No drinker would have dared face that allegory.\n",
      "The whole business is very gratifying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley himself was progressing slowly in the field of Art. He had\n",
      "finished the 'Child and Cat', and had taken it to Epstein together with\n",
      "a letter of introduction from Sellers. Sellers' habitual attitude now\n",
      "was that of the kindly celebrity who has arrived and wishes to give the\n",
      "youngsters a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its departure Beverley had not done much in the way of actual\n",
      "execution. Whenever Annette came to his studio he was either sitting in\n",
      "a chair with his feet on the window-sill, smoking, or in the same\n",
      "attitude listening to Sellers' views on art. Sellers being on the\n",
      "upgrade, a man with many pounds to his credit in the bank, had more\n",
      "leisure now. He had given up his advertisement work, and was planning a\n",
      "great canvas--another allegorical work. This left him free to devote a\n",
      "good deal of time to Beverley, and he did so. Beverley sat and smoked\n",
      "through his harangues. He may have been listening, or he may not.\n",
      "Annette listened once or twice, and the experience had the effect of\n",
      "sending her to Beverley, quivering with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why do you _let_ him patronize you like that?' she demanded. 'If\n",
      "anybody came and talked to me like that about my music, I'd--I'd--I\n",
      "don't know what I'd do. Yes, even if he were really a great musician.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you consider Sellers a great artist, then, even now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He seems to be able to sell his pictures, so I suppose they must be\n",
      "good; but nothing could give him the right to patronize you as he\n",
      "does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"My learned friend's manner would be intolerable in an emperor to a\n",
      "black-beetle,\"' quoted Beverley. 'Well, what are we going to do about\n",
      "it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If only you could sell a picture, too!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah! Well, I've done my part of the contract. I've delivered the goods.\n",
      "There the thing is at Epstein's. The public can't blame me if it\n",
      "doesn't sell. All they've got to do is to waltz in in their thousands\n",
      "and fight for it. And, by the way, talking of waltzes--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, it's finished,' said Annette, dispiritedly. 'Published too, for\n",
      "that matter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Published! What's the matter, then? Why this drooping sadness? Why\n",
      "aren't you running around the square, singing like a bird?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Because,' said Annette, 'unfortunately, I had to pay the expenses of\n",
      "publication. It was only five pounds, but the sales haven't caught up\n",
      "with that yet. If they ever do, perhaps there'll be a new edition.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And will you have to pay for that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No. The publishers would.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who are they?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Grusczinsky and Buchterkirch.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Heavens, then what are you worrying about? The thing's a cert. A man\n",
      "with a name like Grusczinsky could sell a dozen editions by himself.\n",
      "Helped and inspired by Buchterkirch, he will make the waltz the talk of\n",
      "the country. Infants will croon it in their cots.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He didn't seem to think so when I saw him last.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not. He doesn't know his own power. Grusczinsky's shrinking\n",
      "diffidence is a by-word in musical circles. He is the genuine Human\n",
      "Violet. You must give him time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll give him anything if he'll only sell an edition or two,' said\n",
      "Annette.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outstanding thing was that he did. There seemed no particular\n",
      "reason why the sale of that waltz should not have been as small and as\n",
      "slow as that of any other waltz by an unknown composer. But almost\n",
      "without warning it expanded from a trickle into a flood. Grusczinsky,\n",
      "beaming paternally whenever Annette entered the shop--which was\n",
      "often--announced two new editions in a week. Beverley, his artistic\n",
      "growth still under a watchful eye of Sellers, said he had never had\n",
      "any doubts as to the success of the thing from the moment when a single\n",
      "phrase in it had so carried him away that he had been compelled to stamp\n",
      "his applause enthusiastically on the floor. Even Sellers forgot his own\n",
      "triumphs long enough to allow him to offer affable congratulations. And\n",
      "money came rolling in, smoothing the path of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were great days. There was a hat ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Life, in short, was very full and splendid. There was, indeed, but one\n",
      "thing which kept it from being perfect. The usual drawback to success is\n",
      "that it annoys one's friends so; but in Annette's case this drawback was\n",
      "absent. Sellers' demeanour towards her was that of an old-established\n",
      "inmate welcoming a novice into the Hall of Fame. Her pupils--worthy\n",
      "souls, though bone-headed--fawned upon her. Beverley seemed more pleased\n",
      "than anyone. Yet it was Beverley who prevented her paradise from being\n",
      "complete. Successful herself, she wanted all her friends to be successful;\n",
      "but Beverley, to her discomfort, remained a cheery failure, and worse,\n",
      "absolutely refused to snub Sellers. It was not as if Sellers' advice and\n",
      "comments were disinterested. Beverley was simply the instrument on which\n",
      "he played his songs of triumph. It distressed Annette to such an extent\n",
      "that now, if she went upstairs and heard Sellers' voice in the studio,\n",
      "she came down again without knocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon, sitting in her room, she heard the telephone-bell ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The telephone was on the stairs, just outside her door. She went out\n",
      "and took up the receiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Halloa!' said a querulous voice. 'Is Mr Beverley there?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette remembered having heard him go out. She could always tell his\n",
      "footstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He is out,' she said. 'Is there any message?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said the voice, emphatically. 'Tell him that Rupert Morrison\n",
      "rang up to ask what he was to do with all this great stack of music\n",
      "that's arrived. Does he want it forwarded on to him, or what?' The\n",
      "voice was growing high and excited. Evidently Mr Morrison was in a\n",
      "state of nervous tension when a man does not care particularly who\n",
      "hears his troubles so long as he unburdens himself of them to someone.\n",
      "\n",

      "Thereafter they contented themselves with sitting massively about in\n",
      "corners, glowering at each other. Still, it was all very jolly and\n",
      "sociable, and helped to pass the long evenings. And, as Mrs Williams\n",
      "pointed out, in reply to some rather strong remarks from Mr Williams on\n",
      "the subject of packs of young fools who made it impossible for a man to\n",
      "get a quiet smoke in his own home, it kept them out of the public-houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Kitchener, meanwhile, observed the invasion with growing dismay.\n",
      "Shyness barred him from the evening gatherings, and what was going on\n",
      "in that house, with young bloods like Ted Pringle, Albert Parsons,\n",
      "Arthur Brown, and Joe Blossom (to name four of the most assiduous)\n",
      "exercising their fascinations at close range, he did not like to\n",
      "think. Again and again he strove to brace himself up to join the feasts\n",
      "of reason and flows of soul which he knew were taking place nightly\n",
      "around the object of his devotions, but every time he failed. Habit is\n",
      "a terrible thing; it shackles the strongest, and Tom had fallen into\n",
      "the habit of inquiring after Mr Williams' rheumatism over the garden\n",
      "fence first thing in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a civil, neighbourly thing to do, but it annihilated the only\n",
      "excuse he could think of for looking in at night. He could not help\n",
      "himself. It was like some frightful scourge--the morphine habit, or\n",
      "something of that sort. Every morning he swore to himself that nothing\n",
      "would induce him to mention the subject of rheumatism, but no sooner\n",
      "had the stricken old gentleman's head appeared above the fence than\n",
      "out it came.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Morning, Mr Williams.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Morning, Tom.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Pause, indicative of a strong man struggling with himself; then:\n",
      "\n",
      "'How's the rheumatism, Mr Williams?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Better, thank'ee, Tom.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And there he was, with his guns spiked.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he did not give up. He brought to his wooing the same\n",
      "determination which had made him second gardener at the Hall at\n",
      "twenty-five. He was a novice at the game, but instinct told him that a\n",
      "good line of action was to shower gifts. He did so. All he had to shower\n",
      "was vegetables, and he showered them in a way that would have caused the\n",
      "goddess Ceres to be talked about. His garden became a perfect crater,\n",
      "erupting vegetables. Why vegetables? I think I hear some heckler cry.\n",
      "Why not flowers--fresh, fair, fragrant flowers? You can do a lot with\n",
      "flowers. Girls love them. There is poetry in them. And, what is more,\n",
      "there is a recognized language of flowers. Shoot in a rose, or a\n",
      "calceolaria, or an herbaceous border, or something, I gather, and you\n",
      "have made a formal proposal of marriage without any of the trouble of\n",
      "rehearsing a long speech and practising appropriate gestures in front\n",
      "of your bedroom looking-glass. Why, then, did not Thomas Kitchener give\n",
      "Sally Preston flowers? Well, you see, unfortunately, it was now late\n",
      "autumn, and there were no flowers. Nature had temporarily exhausted her\n",
      "floral blessings, and was jogging along with potatoes and artichokes\n",
      "and things. Love is like that. It invariably comes just at the wrong\n",
      "time. A few months before there had been enough roses in Tom\n",
      "Kitchener's garden to win the hearts of a dozen girls. Now there were\n",
      "only vegetables, 'Twas ever thus.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to be expected that a devotion so practically displayed\n",
      "should escape comment. This was supplied by that shrewd observer, old\n",
      "Mr Williams. He spoke seriously to Tom across the fence on the subject\n",
      "of his passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Young Tom,' he said, 'drop it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom muttered unintelligibly. Mr Williams adjusted the top-hat without\n",
      "which he never stirred abroad, even into his garden. He blinked\n",
      "benevolently at Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're making up to that young gal of Jane's,' he proceeded. 'You\n",
      "can't deceive _me_. All these p'taties, and what not. _I_ seen\n",
      "your game fast enough. Just you drop it, young Tom.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why?' muttered Tom, rebelliously. A sudden distaste for old Mr\n",
      "Williams blazed within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why? 'Cos you'll only burn your fingers if you don't, that's why. I\n",
      "been watching this young gal of Jane's, and I seen what sort of a young\n",
      "gal she be. She's a flipperty piece, that's what she be. You marry that\n",
      "young gal, Tom, and you'll never have no more quiet and happiness.\n",
      "She'd just take and turn the place upsy-down on you. The man as marries\n",
      "that young gal has got to be master in his own home. He's got to show\n",
      "her what's what. Now, you ain't got the devil in you to do that, Tom.\n",
      "You're what I might call a sort of a sheep. I admires it in you, Tom. I\n",
      "like to see a young man steady and quiet, same as what you be. So\n",
      "that's how it is, you see. Just you drop this foolishness, young Tom,\n",
      "and leave that young gal be, else you'll burn your fingers, same as\n",
      "what I say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And, giving his top-hat a rakish tilt, the old gentleman ambled\n",
      "indoors, satisfied that he had dropped a guarded hint in a pleasant and\n",
      "tactful manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be supposed that this interview stung Tom to swift action.\n",
      "Otherwise, one cannot explain why he should not have been just as\n",
      "reticent on the subject nearest his heart when bestowing on Sally the\n",
      "twenty-seventh cabbage as he had been when administering the hundred\n",
      "and sixtieth potato. At any rate, the fact remains that, as that\n",
      "fateful vegetable changed hands across the fence, something resembling\n",
      "a proposal of marriage did actually proceed from him. As a sustained\n",
      "piece of emotional prose it fell short of the highest standard. Most of\n",
      "it was lost at the back of his throat, and what did emerge was mainly\n",
      "inaudible. However, as she distinctly caught the word 'love' twice, and\n",
      "as Tom was shuffling his feet and streaming with perspiration, and\n",
      "looking everywhere at once except at her, Sally grasped the situation.\n",
      "Whereupon, without any visible emotion, she accepted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had to ask her to repeat her remark. He could not believe his\n",
      "luck. It is singular how diffident a normally self-confident man can\n",
      "become, once he is in love. When Colonel Milvery, of the Hall, had\n",
      "informed him of his promotion to the post of second gardener, Tom had\n",
      "demanded no _encore_. He knew his worth. He was perfectly aware\n",
      "that he was a good gardener, and official recognition of the fact left\n",
      "him gratified, but unperturbed. But this affair of Sally was quite\n",
      "another matter. It had revolutionized his standards of value--forced\n",
      "him to consider himself as a man, entirely apart from his skill as a\n",
      "gardener. And until this moment he had had grave doubt as to whether,\n",
      "apart from his skill as a gardener, he amounted to much.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was overwhelmed. He kissed Sally across the fence humbly. Sally, for\n",
      "her part, seemed very unconcerned about it all. A more critical man\n",
      "than Thomas Kitchener might have said that, to all appearances, the\n",
      "thing rather bored Sally.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't tell anybody just yet,' she stipulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom would have given much to be allowed to announce his triumph\n",
      "defiantly to old Mr Williams, to say nothing of making a considerable\n",
      "noise about it in the village; but her wish was law, and he reluctantly\n",
      "agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "There are moments in a man's life when, however enthusiastic a\n",
      "gardener he may be, his soul soars above vegetables. Tom's shot with a\n",
      "jerk into the animal kingdom. The first present he gave Sally in his\n",
      "capacity of fiance was a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a half-grown puppy with long legs and a long tail, belonging\n",
      "to no one species, but generously distributing itself among about six.\n",
      "Sally loved it, and took it with her wherever she went. And on one of\n",
      "these rambles down swooped Constable Cobb, the village policeman,\n",
      "pointing out that, contrary to regulations, the puppy had no collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible that a judicious meekness on Sally's part might have\n",
      "averted disaster. Mr Cobb was human, and Sally was looking\n",
      "particularly attractive that morning. Meekness, however, did not come\n",
      "easily to Sally. In a speech which began as argument and ended (Mr\n",
      "Cobb proving solid and unyielding) as pure cheek, she utterly routed\n",
      "the constable. But her victory was only a moral one, for as she turned\n",
      "to go Mr Cobb, dull red and puffing slightly, was already entering\n",
      "particulars of the affair in his note-book, and Sally knew that the\n",
      "last word was with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her way back she met Tom Kitchener. He was looking very tough and\n",
      "strong, and at the sight of him a half-formed idea, which she had\n",
      "regretfully dismissed as impracticable, of assaulting Constable Cobb,\n",
      "returned to her in an amended form. Tom did not know it, but the\n",
      "reason why she smiled so radiantly upon him at that moment was that she\n",
      "had just elected him to the post of hired assassin. While she did not\n",
      "want Constable Cobb actually assassinated, she earnestly desired him\n",
      "to have his helmet smashed down over his eyes; and it seemed to her\n",
      "that Tom was the man to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She poured out her grievance to him and suggested her scheme. She even\n",
      "elaborated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why shouldn't you wait for him one night and throw him into the creek?\n",
      "It isn't deep, and it's jolly muddy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Um!' said Tom, doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It would just teach him,' she pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prospect of undertaking the higher education of the police did\n",
      "not seem to appeal to Tom. In his heart he rather sympathized with\n",
      "Constable Cobb. He saw the policeman's point of view. It is all very\n",
      "well to talk, but when you are stationed in a sleepy village where no\n",
      "one ever murders, or robs, or commits arson, or even gets drunk and\n",
      "disorderly in the street, a puppy without a collar is simply a godsend.\n",
      "A man must look out for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to make this side of the question clear to Sally, but failed\n",
      "signally. She took a deplorable view of his attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I might have known you'd have been afraid,' she said, with a\n",
      "contemptuous jerk of her chin. 'Good morning.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom flushed. He knew he had never been afraid of anything in his life,\n",
      "except her; but nevertheless the accusation stung. And as he was still\n",
      "afraid of her he stammered as he began to deny the charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, leave off!' said Sally, irritably. 'Suck a lozenge.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm not afraid,' said Tom, condensing his remarks to their minimum as\n",
      "his only chance of being intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm not. It's just that I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "A nasty gleam came into Sally's eyes. Her manner was haughty.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It doesn't matter.' She paused. 'I've no doubt Ted Pringle will do\n",
      "what I want.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For all her contempt, she could not keep a touch of uneasiness from her\n",
      "eyes as she prepared to make her next remark. There was a look about\n",
      "Tom's set jaw which made her hesitate. But her temper had run away with\n",
      "her, and she went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am sure he will,' she said. 'When we became engaged he said that he\n",
      "would do anything for me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some speeches that are such conversational knockout blows\n",
      "that one can hardly believe that life will ever pick itself up and go\n",
      "on again after them. Yet it does. The dramatist brings down the\n",
      "curtain on such speeches. The novelist blocks his reader's path with a\n",
      "zareba of stars. But in life there are no curtains, no stars, nothing\n",
      "final and definite--only ragged pauses and discomfort. There was such\n",
      "a pause now.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you mean?' said Tom at last. 'You promised to marry me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know I did--and I promised to marry Ted Pringle!'\n",
      "\n",
      "That touch of panic which she could not wholly repress, the panic that\n",
      "comes to everyone when a situation has run away with them like a\n",
      "strange, unmanageable machine, infused a shade too much of the defiant\n",
      "into Sally's manner. She had wished to be cool, even casual, but she\n",
      "was beginning to be afraid. Why, she could not have said. Certainly she\n",
      "did not anticipate violence on Tom's part. Perhaps that was it. Perhaps\n",
      "it was just because he was so quiet that she was afraid. She had always\n",
      "looked on him contemptuously as an amiable, transparent lout, and now\n",
      "he was puzzling her. She got an impression of something formidable\n",
      "behind his stolidity, something that made her feel mean and\n",
      "insignificant.\n",
      "\n",
      "She fought against the feeling, but it gripped her; and, in spite of\n",
      "herself, she found her voice growing shrill and out of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I promised to marry Ted Pringle, and I promised to marry Joe Blossom,\n",
      "and I promised to marry Albert Parsons. And I was going to promise to\n",
      "marry Arthur Brown and anybody else who asked me. So now you know! I\n",
      "told you I'd make father take me back to London. Well, when he hears\n",
      "that I've promised to marry four different men, I bet he'll have me\n",
      "home by the first train.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped. She had more to say, but she could not say it. She stood\n",
      "looking at him. And he looked at her. His face was grey and his mouth\n",
      "oddly twisted. Silence seemed to fall on the whole universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sally was really afraid now, and she knew it. She was feeling very\n",
      "small and defenceless in an extremely alarming world. She could not\n",
      "have said what it was that had happened to her. She only knew that life\n",
      "had become of a sudden very vivid, and that her ideas as to what was\n",
      "amusing had undergone a striking change. A man's development is a slow\n",
      "and steady process of the years--a woman's a thing of an instant. In\n",
      "the silence which followed her words Sally had grown up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom broke the silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that true?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice made her start. He had spoken quietly, but there was a new\n",
      "note in it, strange to her. Just as she could not have said what it was\n",
      "that had happened to her, so now she could not have said what had\n",
      "happened to Tom. He, too, had changed, but how she did not know. Yet\n",
      "the explanation was simple. He also had, in a sense, grown up. He was\n",
      "no longer afraid of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood thinking. Hours seemed to pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come along!' he said, at last, and he began to move off down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sally followed. The possibility of refusing did not enter her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where are you going?' she asked. It was unbearable, this silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this fashion, he leading, she following, they went down the road\n",
      "into a lane, and through a gate into a field. They passed into a second\n",
      "field, and as they did so Sally's heart gave a leap. Ted Pringle was\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ted Pringle was a big young man, bigger even than Tom Kitchener, and,\n",
      "like Tom, he was of silent habit. He eyed the little procession\n",
      "inquiringly, but spoke no word. There was a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ted,' said Tom, 'there's been a mistake.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped quickly to Sally's side, and the next moment he had swung\n",
      "her off her feet and kissed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the type of mind that Millbourne breeds, actions speak louder than\n",
      "words, and Ted Pringle, who had gaped, gaped no more. He sprang\n",
      "forward, and Tom, pushing Sally aside, turned to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot help feeling a little sorry for Ted Pringle. In the light of\n",
      "what happened, I could wish that it were possible to portray him as a\n",
      "hulking brute of evil appearance and worse morals--the sort of person\n",
      "concerning whom one could reflect comfortably that he deserved all he\n",
      "got. I should like to make him an unsympathetic character, over whose\n",
      "downfall the reader would gloat. But honesty compels me to own that Ted\n",
      "was a thoroughly decent young man in every way. He was a good citizen,\n",
      "a dutiful son, and would certainly have made an excellent husband.\n",
      "Furthermore, in the dispute on hand he had right on his side fully as\n",
      "much as Tom. The whole affair was one of those elemental clashings of\n",
      "man and man where the historian cannot sympathize with either side at\n",
      "the expense of the other, but must confine himself to a mere statement\n",
      "of what occurred. And, briefly, what occurred was that Tom, bringing to\n",
      "the fray a pent-up fury which his adversary had had no time to\n",
      "generate, fought Ted to a complete standstill in the space of two\n",
      "minutes and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sally had watched the proceedings, sick and horrified. She had never\n",
      "seen men fight before, and the terror of it overwhelmed her. Her\n",
      "vanity received no pleasant stimulation from the thought that it was\n",
      "for her sake that this storm had been let loose. For the moment her\n",
      "vanity was dead, stunned by collision with the realities. She found\n",
      "herself watching in a dream. She saw Ted fall, rise, fall again, and\n",
      "lie where he had fallen; and then she was aware that Tom was speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come along!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She hung back. Ted was lying very still. Gruesome ideas presented\n",
      "themselves. She had just accepted them as truth when Ted wriggled. He\n",
      "wriggled again. Then he sat up suddenly, looked at her with unseeing\n",
      "eyes, and said something in a thick voice. She gave a little sob of\n",
      "relief. It was ghastly, but not so ghastly as what she had been\n",
      "imagining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody touched her arm. Tom was by her side, grim and formidable. He\n",
      "was wiping blood from his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come along!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed him without a word. And presently, behold, in another\n",
      "field, whistling meditatively and regardless of impending ill, Albert\n",
      "Parsons.\n",
      "\n",
      "In everything that he did Tom was a man of method. He did not depart\n",
      "from his chosen formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Albert,' he said, 'there's been a mistake.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Albert gaped, as Ted had gaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom kissed Sally with the gravity of one performing a ritual.\n",
      "\n",
      "The uglinesses of life, as we grow accustomed to them, lose their power\n",
      "to shock, and there is no doubt that Sally looked with a different eye\n",
      "upon this second struggle. She was conscious of a thrill of\n",
      "excitement, very different from the shrinking horror which had seized\n",
      "her before. Her stunned vanity began to tingle into life again. The\n",
      "fight was raging furiously over the trampled turf, and quite suddenly,\n",
      "as she watched, she was aware that her heart was with Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no longer two strange brutes fighting in a field. It was her man\n",
      "battling for her sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "She desired overwhelmingly that he should win, that he should not be\n",
      "hurt, that he should sweep triumphantly over Albert Parsons as he had\n",
      "swept over Ted Pringle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it was evident, even to her, that he was being hurt, and\n",
      "that he was very far from sweeping triumphantly over Albert Parsons. He\n",
      "had not allowed himself time to recover from his first battle, and his\n",
      "blows were slow and weary. Albert, moreover, was made of sterner stuff\n",
      "than Ted. Though now a peaceful tender of cows, there had been a time\n",
      "in his hot youth when, travelling with a circus, he had fought, week\n",
      "in, week out, relays of just such rustic warriors as Tom. He knew their\n",
      "methods--their headlong rushes, their swinging blows. They were the\n",

      "stare; but this was a special occasion. Ordinary rules of conventional\n",
      "etiquette could not apply to a case like this. He stared. More, he\n",
      "gaped. As the girl passed on into the shadow of the pier he leaned\n",
      "farther over the rail, and his neck extended in joints like a\n",
      "telescope.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point the girl turned to swim on her back. Her eyes met his.\n",

      "shot past under the pier.\n",
      "\n",
      "George's neck was now at its full stretch. No power of will or muscle\n",

      "into a lamp-post in the street. When, therefore, he came to the\n",
      "surface he prepared without agitation to strike out in his usual bold\n",
      "fashion. At this moment, however, two hands, grasping him beneath the\n",
      "arms, lifted his head still farther from the waves, and a voice in his\n",
      "ear said, 'Keep still; don't struggle. There's no danger.'\n",
      "\n",
      "George did not struggle. His brain, working with the cool rapidity of a\n",

      "more difficult in this world for a young man than the securing of an\n",
      "introduction to the right girl under just the right conditions. When he\n",
      "is looking his best he is presented to her in the midst of a crowd, and\n",
      "is swept away after a rapid hand-shake. When there is no crowd he has\n",

      "of young lives have been saddened in this manner.\n",

      "acquaintanceship, if nothing more, which could not lightly be broken. A\n",
      "girl who has saved a man from drowning cannot pass him by next day with\n",
      "a formal bow. And what a girl, too! There had been a time, in extreme\n",
      "youth, when his feminine ideal was the sort of girl who has fuzzy,\n",
      "golden hair, and drops things. Indeed in his first year at the\n",

      "episode concluding with a strong little drama, in which a wrathful,\n",

      "dropping them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pleasantest functions must come to an end sooner or later; and in\n",
      "due season George felt his heels grate on the sand. His preserver\n",
      "loosed her hold. They stood up and faced each other. George began to\n",

      "his University, the discovery leading to his tearing himself away from\n",
      "Alma Mater by request with some suddenness. He was a long, slender\n",

      "the sound of his own voice.\n",

      "'Well, here we are,' he said, kicking breezily at George's leg with his\n",

      "to the minute.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What happened after I left?' George asked. 'Has anybody begun to act\n",
      "yet? Or are they waiting till the dress-rehearsal?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The rehearsals,' admitted Mr Mifflin, handsomely, 'weren't perfect;\n",
      "but you wait. It'll be all right on the night.'\n",
      "\n",
      "George thought he had never heard such a futile, vapid remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Besides,' said Mr Mifflin, 'I have an idea which will make the show.\n",
      "Lend me your ear--both ears. You shall have them back. Tell me: what\n",
      "pulls people into a theatre? A good play? Sometimes. But failing that,\n",
      "as in the present case, what? Fine acting by the leading juvenile? We\n",
      "have that, but it is not enough. No, my boy; advertisement is the\n",
      "thing. Look at all these men on the beach. Are they going to roll in of\n",
      "their own free wills to see a play like _The Footpills_? Not on\n",
      "your life. About the time the curtain rises every man of them will be\n",

      "know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't,' said George, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Unless,' proceeded Mr Mifflin, 'we advertise. And by advertise, I\n",
      "mean advertise in the right way. We have a Press-agent, but for all the\n",
      "good he does he might be back on the old farm, gathering in the hay.\n",
      "Luckily for us, I am among those present. I have brains, I have\n",

      "\n",
      "'I said nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you did. Well, I have an idea which will drag these people\n",

      "\n",
      "'What is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll tell you later. There are a few details to be worked upon first.\n",
      "Meanwhile, let us trickle to the sea-front and take a sail in one of\n",
      "those boats. I am at my best in a boat. I rather fancy Nature intended\n",
      "me for a Viking.'\n",

      "meditative voice, seated himself at the helm, somewhat saddened by his\n",
      "failure to borrow a quid of tobacco from the _Ocean Beauty's_\n",
      "proprietor. For, as he justly observed, without properties and make-up,\n",
      "where were you? George, being skilled in the ways of boats, was in\n",
      "charge of the sheet. The summer day had lost its oppressive heat. The\n",
      "sun no longer beat down on the face of the waters. A fresh breeze had\n",
      "sprung up. George, manipulating the sheet automatically, fell into a\n",
      "reverie. A moment comes in the life of every man when an inward voice\n",
      "whispers to him, 'This is The One!' In George's case the voice had not\n",
      "whispered; it had shouted. From now onward there could be but one woman\n",
      "in the world for him. From now onwards--The _Ocean Beauty_ gave a\n",
      "sudden plunge. George woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What the deuce are you doing with that tiller?' he inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My gentle somnambulist,' said Mr Mifflin, aggrieved, 'I was doing\n",
      "nothing with this tiller. We will now form a commission to inquire into\n",
      "what you were doing with that sheet. Were you asleep?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My fault,' said George; 'I was thinking.'\n",

      "complainingly, 'I wish you would wait till we get ashore. You nearly\n",
      "upset us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It shan't happen again. They are tricky, these sailing boats--turn\n",
      "over in a second. Whatever you do, don't get her broadside on. There's\n",
      "more breeze out here than I thought there was.'\n",

      "some little thought, some little, apparently obvious, idea which stamps\n",
      "the man of genius. It beats me why I didn't think of it before. Why, of\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr Mifflin's artistic misgivings as to his colleague's ability to\n",
      "handle so subtle a part as that of rescuee were more than justified on\n",
      "their arrival. A large and interested audience had collected by the\n",
      "time they reached the shore, an audience to which any artist should\n",
      "have been glad to play; but George, forcing his way through, hurried to\n",
      "the hotel without attempting to satisfy them. Not a single silent\n",
      "hand-shake did he bestow on his rescuer. There was no catch in his voice\n",
      "as he made the one remark which he did make--to a man with whiskers who\n",
      "asked him if the boat had upset. As an exhibition of rapid footwork\n",
      "his performance was good. In other respects it was poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just changed his wet clothes--it seemed to him that he had\n",
      "been doing nothing but change his wet clothes since he had come to\n",
      "Marvis Bay--when Mr Mifflin entered in a bathrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They lent me this downstairs,' he explained, 'while they dried my\n",
      "clothes. They would do anything for me. I'm the popular hero. My boy,\n",
      "you made the mistake of your life when you threw up the rescuer part.\n",
      "It has all the fat. I see that now. The rescuer plays the other man off\n",
      "the stage every time. I've just been interviewed by the fellow on the\n",
      "local newspaper. He's correspondent to a couple of London papers. The\n",
      "country will ring with this thing. I've told them all the parts I've\n",
      "ever played and my favourite breakfast food. There's a man coming up to\n",
      "take my photograph tomorrow. _Footpills_ stock has gone up with a\n",
      "run. Wait till Monday and see what sort of a house we shall draw. By\n",
      "the way, the reporter fellow said one funny thing. He asked if you\n",
      "weren't the same man who was rescued yesterday by a girl. I said of\n",
      "course not--that you had only come down yesterday. But he stuck to it\n",
      "that you were.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'It's the heat,' he declared, finally. 'That and the worry of\n",
      "rehearsals. I expect a doctor could give the technical name for it.\n",
      "It's a what-do-you-call-it--an obsession. You often hear of cases.\n",
      "Fellows who are absolutely sane really, but cracked on one particular\n",
      "subject. Some of them think they're teapots and things. You've got a\n",
      "craving for being rescued from drowning. What happens, old man? Do you\n",
      "suddenly get the delusion that you can't swim? No, it can't be that,\n",
      "because you were doing all the swimming for the two of us just now. I\n",
      "don't know, though. Maybe you didn't realize that you were swimming?'\n",

      "to the shore, would you say, \"Much obliged, but you needn't have been\n",
      "so officious. I can swim perfectly well?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Mifflin considered this point. Intelligence began to dawn in his\n",

      "all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'This morning'--George's voice grew dreamy--'she gave me a\n",
      "swimming-lesson. She thought it was my first. Don't cackle like that.\n",
      "There's nothing to laugh at.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Mifflin contradicted this assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is you,' he said, simply. 'This should be a lesson to you,\n",
      "George. Avoid deceit. In future be simple and straightforward. Take me\n",
      "as your model. You have managed to scrape through this time. Don't risk\n",
      "it again. You are young. There is still time to make a fresh start. It\n",

      "Three days had passed since his last sight of the company at work, and\n",
      "in those three days, apparently, the impossible had been achieved.\n",
      "There was a snap and go about the piece now. The leading lady had at\n",

      "Arthur Mifflin, as if refreshed and braced by his salt-water bath, was\n",
      "infusing a welcome vigour into his part. And even the comedian, George\n",
      "could not help admitting, showed signs of being on the eve of becoming\n",

      "For a time this little thunderstorm undoubtedly cleared the air. For a\n",

      "light brown leather, very smart. He gave her some chocolates to eat in\n",
      "the Tube. He entertained her with amazing statistics, culled from the\n",
      "weekly paper which he bought on Tuesdays. He was, in short, the perfect\n",
      "lover. On the second day the red-faced man came in again. Arthur joined\n",
      "in the laughter at his stories. Everything seemed ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could not last. Gradually things slipped back into the old routine.\n",
      "Maud, looking up from her work, would see the frown and the bitten lip.\n",
      "She began again to feel uncomfortable and self-conscious as she worked.\n",
      "Sometimes their conversation on the way to the Tube was almost formal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was useless to say anything. She had a wholesome horror of being one\n",
      "of those women who nagged; and she felt that to complain again would\n",
      "amount to nagging. She tried to put the thing out of her mind, but it\n",
      "insisted on staying there. In a way she understood his feelings. He\n",
      "loved her so much, she supposed, that he hated the idea of her\n",
      "exchanging a single word with another man. This, in the abstract, was\n",
      "gratifying; but in practice it distressed her. She wished she were some\n",
      "sort of foreigner, so that nobody could talk to her. But then they\n",
      "would look at her, and that probably would produce much the same\n",
      "results. It was a hard world for a girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the strange thing happened. Arthur reformed. One might almost\n",
      "say that he reformed with a jerk. It was a parallel case to those\n",
      "sudden conversions at Welsh revival meetings. On Monday evening he had\n",
      "been at his worst. On the following morning he was a changed man. Not\n",
      "even after the original thunderstorm had he been more docile. Maud\n",
      "could not believe that first. The lip, once bitten, was stretched in a\n",
      "smile. She looked for the frown. It was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day it was the same; and the day after that. When a week had gone\n",
      "by, and still the improvement was maintained, Maud felt that she might\n",
      "now look upon it as permanent. A great load seemed to have been taken\n",
      "off her mind. She revised her views on the world. It was a very good\n",

      "good thing as absence of jealousy. Little by little Maud began to grow\n",

      "Before the end of the day Maud knew the whole passage by heart. The\n",
      "more her mind dwelt on it, the more clearly did it seem to express what\n",
      "she had felt but could not put into words. The point about jousting\n",
      "struck her as particularly well taken. She had looked up 'joust' in the\n",
      "dictionary, and it seemed to her that in these few words was contained\n",
      "the kernel of her trouble. In the old days, if any man had attempted to\n",
      "rival him in her affections (outside business hours), Arthur would\n",
      "undoubtedly have jousted--and jousted with the vigour of one who means\n",

      "Alphonse.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no time to lose. An hour after her first perusal of Dr\n",
      "Cupid's advice, Maud had begun to act upon it. By the time the first\n",
      "lull in the morning's work had come, and there was a chance for private\n",
      "conversation, she had invented an imaginary young man, a shadowy\n",
      "Lothario, who, being introduced into her home on the previous Sunday by\n",
      "her brother Horace, had carried on in a way you wouldn't believe,\n",

      "\n",

      "'Lovely it was,' went on Maud, dully conscious of failure, but\n",
      "stippling in like an artist the little touches which give atmosphere\n",
      "and verisimilitude to a story. 'All scented. Horace will tease me about\n",
      "it, I can tell you.'\n",
      "\n",

      "jealousy at such a tale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur did not even wince. He was charming about it. Thought it very\n",
      "kind of the young fellow. Didn't blame him for being struck by the\n",
      "whiteness of her hands. Touched on the history of soap, which he\n",
      "happened to have been reading up in the encyclopedia at the free\n",
      "library. And behaved altogether in such a thoroughly gentlemanly\n",
      "fashion that Maud stayed awake half the night, crying.\n",

      "following day there entered the shop and her life a young man who was\n",
      "not imaginary--a Lothario of flesh and blood. He made his entry with\n",

      "Mr 'Skipper' Shute belonged to the last-named of the three classes. He\n",
      "had arrived in England two months previously for the purpose of holding\n",
      "a conference at eight-stone four with one Joseph Edwardes, to settle a\n",
      "question of superiority at that weight which had been vexing the\n",
      "sporting public of two countries for over a year. Having successfully\n",
      "out-argued Mr Edwardes, mainly by means of strenuous work in the\n",
      "clinches, he was now on the eve of starting on a lucrative music-hall\n",
      "tour with his celebrated inaudible monologue. As a result of these\n",
      "things he was feeling very, very pleased with the world in general, and\n",
      "with Mr Skipper Shute in particular. And when Mr Shute was pleased with\n",
      "himself his manner was apt to be of the breeziest.\n",
      "\n",
      "He breezed into the shop, took a seat, and, having cast an experienced\n",

      "\n",
      "At any other time Maud might have resented being addressed as 'kid' by\n",
      "a customer, but now she welcomed it. With the exception of a slight\n",
      "thickening of the lobe of one ear, Mr Shute bore no outward signs of\n",
      "his profession. And being, to use his own phrase, a 'swell dresser', he\n",
      "was really a most presentable young man. Just, in fact, what Maud\n",
      "needed. She saw in him her last hope. If any faint spark of his ancient\n",
      "fire still lingered in Arthur, it was through Mr Shute that it must be\n",
      "fanned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled upon Mr Shute. She worked on his robust fingers as if it\n",
      "were an artistic treat to be permitted to handle them. So carefully did\n",
      "she toil that she was still busy when Arthur, taking off his apron and\n",

      "The door had scarcely shut when Mr Shute bent forward.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And, taking up his cane, straw hat, and yellow gloves, Mr Shute\n",
      "departed, leaving Maud to her thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was disappointed. She had expected better results. Mr Shute had\n",
      "lowered with ease the record for gay badinage, hitherto held by the\n",
      "red-faced customer; yet to all appearances there had been no change in\n",
      "Arthur's manner. But perhaps he had scowled (or bitten his lip), and\n",
      "she had not noticed it. Apparently he had struck Mr Shute, an unbiased\n",
      "spectator, as gloomy. Perhaps at some moment when her eyes had been on\n",
      "her work--She hoped for the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his feelings may have been during the afternoon, Arthur was\n",
      "undeniably cheerful that evening. He was in excellent spirits. His\n",
      "light-hearted abandon on the Wiggle-Woggle had been noted and commented\n",
      "upon by several lookers-on. Confronted with the Hairy Ainus, he had\n",
      "touched a high level of facetiousness. And now, as he sat with her\n",
      "listening to the band, he was crooning joyously to himself in\n",
      "accompaniment to the music, without, it would appear, a care in the\n",
      "world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud was hurt and anxious. In a mere acquaintance this blithe attitude\n",
      "would have been welcome. It would have helped her to enjoy her evening.\n",
      "But from Arthur at that particular moment she looked for something\n",
      "else. Why was he cheerful? Only a few hours ago she had been--yes,\n",
      "flirting with another man before his very eyes. What right had he to be\n",
      "cheerful? He ought to be heated, full of passionate demands for an\n",
      "explanation--a flushed, throaty thing to be coaxed back into a good\n",
      "temper and then forgiven--all this at great length--for having been in\n",
      "a bad one. Yes, she told herself, she had wanted certainty one way or\n",
      "the other, and here it was. Now she knew. He no longer cared for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cold?' said Arthur. 'Let's walk. Evenings beginning to draw in now.\n",
      "Lum-da-diddley-ah. That's what I call a good tune. Give me something\n",
      "lively and bright. Dumty-umpty-iddley-ah. Dum tum--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Funny thing--' said Maud, deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's a funny thing?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The gentleman in the brown suit whose hands I did this afternoon--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He was,' agreed Arthur, brightly. 'A very funny thing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud frowned. Wit at the expense of Hairy Ainus was one thing--at her\n",
      "own another.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was about to say,' she went on precisely, 'that it was a funny\n",
      "thing, a coincidence, seeing that I was already engaged, that the\n",
      "gentleman in the brown suit whose hands I did this afternoon should\n",
      "have asked me to come here, to the White City, with him tonight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment they walked on in silence. To Maud it seemed a hopeful\n",
      "silence. Surely it must be the prelude to an outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh!' he said, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud's heart gave a leap. Surely that was the old tone?\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of paces, and he spoke again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't hear him ask you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice was disappointingly level.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He asked me after you had gone out to lunch.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a nuisance,' said Arthur, cheerily, 'when things clash like that.\n",
      "But perhaps he'll ask you again. Nothing to prevent you coming here\n",
      "twice. Well repays a second visit, I always say. I think--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You shouldn't,' said a voice behind him. 'It hurts the head. Well,\n",
      "kid, being shown a good time?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of meeting Mr Shute had not occurred to Maud. She had\n",
      "assumed that, being aware that she would be there with another, he\n",
      "would have stayed away. It may, however, be remarked that she did not\n",
      "know Mr Shute. He was not one of your sensitive plants. He smiled\n",
      "pleasantly upon her, looking very dapper in evening dress and a silk\n",
      "hat that, though a size too small for him, shone like a mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud hardly knew whether she was glad or sorry to see him. It did not\n",
      "seem to matter much now either way. Nothing seemed to matter much, in\n",
      "fact. Arthur's cheery acceptance of the news that she received\n",
      "invitations from others had been like a blow, leaving her numb and\n",
      "listless.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made the introductions. The two men eyed each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pleased to meet you,' said Mr Shute.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Weather keeps up,' said Arthur.\n",
      "\n",
      "And from that point onward Mr Shute took command.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be assumed that this was not the first time that Mr Shute had\n",
      "made one of a trio in these circumstances, for the swift dexterity with\n",
      "which he lost Arthur was certainly not that of a novice. So smoothly\n",
      "was it done that it was not until she emerged from the Witching Waves,\n",
      "guided by the pugilist's slim but formidable right arm, that Maud\n",
      "realized that Arthur had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave a little cry of dismay. Secretly she was beginning to be\n",
      "somewhat afraid of Mr Shute. He was showing signs of being about to\n",
      "step out of the role she had assigned to him and attempt something on a\n",
      "larger scale. His manner had that extra touch of warmth which makes all\n",
      "the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh! He's gone!' she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure,' said Mr Shute. 'He's got a hurry-call from the Uji Village.\n",
      "The chief's cousin wants a hair-cut.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must find him. We must.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Surest thing you know,' said Mr Shute. 'Plenty of time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must find him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shute regarded her with some displeasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Seems to be ace-high with you, that dub,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't understand you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My observation was,' explained Mr Shute, coldly, 'that, judging from\n",
      "appearances, that dough-faced lemon was Willie-boy, the first and only\n",
      "love.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud turned on him with flaming cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Welsh is nothing to me! Nothing! Nothing!' she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked quickly on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then, if there's a vacancy, star-eyes,' said the pugilist at her side,\n",
      "holding on a hat which showed a tendency to wobble, 'count me in.\n",
      "Directly I saw you--see here, what's the idea of this road-work? We\n",
      "aren't racing--'\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud slowed down.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's better. As I was saying, directly I saw you, I said to myself,\n",
      "\"That's the one you need. The original candy kid. The--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "His hat lurched drunkenly as he answered the girl's increase of speed.\n",
      "He cursed it in a brief aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's what I said. \"The original candy kid.\" So--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He shot out a restraining hand. 'Arthur!' cried Maud. 'Arthur!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's not my name' breathed Mr Shute, tenderly. 'Call me Clarence.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Considered as an embrace, it was imperfect. At these moments a silk\n",
      "hat a size too small handicaps a man. The necessity of having to be\n",
      "careful about the nap prevented Mr Shute from doing himself complete\n",
      "justice. But he did enough to induce Arthur Welsh, who, having sighted\n",
      "the missing ones from afar, had been approaching them at a walking\n",
      "pace, to substitute a run for the walk, and arrive just as Maud\n",
      "wrenched herself free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shute took off his hat, smoothed it, replaced it with extreme care,\n",
      "and turned his attention to the new-comer.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Arthur!' said Maud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her heart gave a great leap. There was no mistaking the meaning in the\n",
      "eye that met hers. He cared! He cared!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Arthur!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He took no notice. His face was pale and working. He strode up to Mr\n",
      "Shute.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well?' he said between his teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "An eight-stone-four champion of the world has many unusual experiences\n",
      "in his life, but he rarely encounters men who say 'Well?' to him\n",
      "between their teeth. Mr Shute eyed this freak with profound wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll teach you to--to kiss young ladies!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shute removed his hat again and gave it another brush. This gave him\n",
      "the necessary time for reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't need it,' he said. 'I've graduated.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Put them up!' hissed Arthur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost a shocked look spread itself over the pugilist's face. So might\n",
      "Raphael have looked if requested to draw a pavement-picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You aren't speaking to ME?' he said, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Put them up!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud, trembling from head to foot, was conscious of one overwhelming\n",
      "emotion. She was terrified--yes. But stronger than the terror was the\n",
      "great wave of elation which swept over her. All her doubts had\n",
      "vanished. At last, after weary weeks of uncertainty, Arthur was about\n",
      "to give the supreme proof. He was going to joust for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of passers-by had paused, interested, to watch developments.\n",
      "You could never tell, of course. Many an apparently promising row never\n",
      "got any farther than words. But, glancing at Arthur's face, they\n",
      "certainly felt justified in pausing. Mr Shute spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If it wasn't,' he said, carefully, 'that I don't want trouble with the\n",
      "Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, I'd--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke off, for, to the accompaniment of a shout of approval from the\n",
      "two spectators, Arthur had swung his right fist, and it had taken him\n",
      "smartly on the side of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with the blows Mr Shute was wont to receive in the exercise of\n",
      "his profession, Arthur's was a gentle tap. But there was one\n",
      "circumstance which gave it a deadliness all its own. Achilles had his\n",
      "heel. Mr Shute's vulnerable point was at the other extremity. Instead\n",
      "of countering, he uttered a cry of agony, and clutched wildly with both\n",
      "hands at his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was too late. It fell to the ground and bounded away, with its\n",
      "proprietor in passionate chase. Arthur snorted and gently chafed his\n",
      "knuckles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a calm about Mr Shute's demeanour as, having given his\n",
      "treasure a final polish and laid it carefully down, he began to advance\n",
      "on his adversary, which was more than ominous. His lips were a thin\n",
      "line of steel. The muscles stood out over his jaw-bones. Crouching in\n",
      "his professional manner, he moved forward softly, like a cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was at this precise moment, just as the two spectators,\n",
      "reinforced now by eleven other men of sporting tastes, were\n",
      "congratulating themselves on their acumen in having stopped to watch,\n",
      "that Police-Constable Robert Bryce, intruding fourteen stones of bone\n",
      "and muscle between the combatants, addressed to Mr Shute these\n",
      "memorable words: ''Ullo, 'ullo! 'Ullo, 'ullo, 'ul-_lo_!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shute appealed to his sense of justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The mutt knocked me hat off.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And I'd do it again,' said Arthur, truculently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not while I'm here you wouldn't, young fellow,' said Mr Bryce, with\n",
      "decision. 'I'm surprised at you,' he went on, pained. 'And you look a\n",
      "respectable young chap, too. You pop off.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A shrill voice from the crowd at this point offered the constable all\n",
      "cinematograph rights if he would allow the contest to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And you pop off, too, all of you,' continued Mr Bryce. 'Blest if I\n",
      "know what kids are coming to nowadays. And as for you,' he said,\n",
      "addressing Mr Shute, 'all you've got to do is to keep that face of\n",
      "yours closed. That's what you've got to do. I've got my eye on you,\n",
      "mind, and if I catch you a-follerin' of him'--he jerked his thumb over\n",

      "luxury and shaded lamps. At Bredin's Parisian Cafe and Restaurant in\n",
      "Soho, where Paul worked, there were none of these things; and Paul\n",
      "himself, though he certainly moved swiftly, was by no means noiseless.\n",
      "His progress through the room resembled in almost equal proportions the\n",
      "finish of a Marathon race, the star-act of a professional juggler, and\n",
      "a monologue by an Earl's Court side-showman. Constant acquaintance\n",
      "rendered regular habitues callous to the wonder, but to a stranger the\n",
      "sight of Paul tearing over the difficult between-tables course, his\n",
      "hands loaded with two vast pyramids of dishes, shouting as he went the\n",
      "mystic word, 'Comingsarecominginamomentsaresteaksareyessarecomingsare!'\n",
      "was impressive to a degree. For doing far less exacting feats on the\n",
      "stage music-hall performers were being paid fifty pounds a week. Paul\n",
      "got eighteen shillings.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a blessing is poverty, properly considered. If Paul had received\n",
      "more than eighteen shillings a week he would not have lived in an\n",
      "attic. He would have luxuriated in a bed-sitting-room on the second\n",
      "floor; and would consequently have missed what was practically a\n",
      "genuine north light. The skylight which went with the attic was so\n",
      "arranged that the room was a studio in miniature, and, as Paul was\n",
      "engaged in his spare moments in painting a great picture, nothing could\n",
      "have been more fortunate; for Paul, like so many of our public men,\n",
      "lived two lives. Off duty, the sprinting, barking juggler of Bredin's\n",
      "Parisian Cafe became the quiet follower of Art. Ever since his\n",
      "childhood he had had a passion for drawing and painting. He regretted\n",
      "that Fate had allowed him so little time for such work; but after all,\n",
      "he reflected, all great artists had had their struggles--so why not\n",
      "he? Moreover, they were now nearly at an end. An hour here, an hour\n",
      "there, and every Thursday a whole afternoon, and the great picture was\n",
      "within measurable distance of completion. He had won through. Without\n",
      "models, without leisure, hungry, tired, he had nevertheless triumphed.\n",
      "A few more touches, and the masterpiece would be ready for purchase. And\n",
      "after that all would be plain sailing. Paul could forecast the scene so\n",
      "exactly. The picture would be at the dealer's, possibly--one must not\n",
      "be too sanguine--thrust away in some odd corner. The wealthy\n",
      "connoisseur would come in. At first he would not see the masterpiece;\n",
      "other more prominently displayed works would catch his eye. He would\n",
      "turn from them in weary scorn, and then!... Paul wondered how big the\n",
      "cheque would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were reasons why he wanted the money. Looking at him as he\n",
      "cantered over the linoleum at Bredin's, you would have said that his\n",
      "mind was on his work. But it was not so. He took and executed orders as\n",
      "automatically as the penny-in-the-slot musical-box in the corner took\n",
      "pennies and produced tunes. His thoughts were of Jeanne Le Brocq, his\n",
      "co-worker at Bredin's, and a little cigar shop down Brixton way which\n",
      "he knew was in the market at a reasonable rate. To marry the former and\n",
      "own the latter was Paul's idea of the earthly paradise, and it was the\n",
      "wealthy connoisseur, and he alone, who could open the gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeanne was a large, slow-moving Norman girl, stolidly handsome. One\n",
      "could picture her in a de Maupassant farmyard. In the clatter and\n",
      "bustle of Bredin's Parisian Cafe she appeared out of place, like a cow\n",
      "in a boiler-factory. To Paul, who worshipped her with all the fervour\n",
      "of a little man for a large woman, her deliberate methods seemed all\n",
      "that was beautiful and dignified. To his mind she lent a tone to the\n",
      "vulgar whirlpool of gorging humanity, as if she had been some goddess\n",
      "mixing in a Homeric battle. The whirlpool had other views--and\n",
      "expressed them. One coarse-fibred brute, indeed, once went so far as to\n",
      "address to her the frightful words, ''Urry up, there, Tottie! Look\n",
      "slippy.' It was wrong, of course, for Paul to slip and spill an order\n",
      "of scrambled eggs down the brute's coat-sleeve, but who can blame him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those who did not see eye to eye with Paul in his views on\n",
      "deportment in waitresses was M. Bredin himself, the owner of the\n",
      "Parisian Cafe; and it was this circumstance which first gave Paul the\n",
      "opportunity of declaring the passion which was gnawing him with the\n",
      "fierce fury of a Bredin customer gnawing a tough steak against time\n",
      "during the rush hour. He had long worshipped her from afar, but nothing\n",
      "more intimate than a 'Good morning, Miss Jeanne', had escaped him,\n",
      "till one day during a slack spell he came upon her in the little\n",
      "passage leading to the kitchen, her face hidden in her apron, her back\n",
      "jerking with sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Business is business. Paul had a message to deliver to the cook\n",
      "respecting 'two fried, coffee, and one stale'. He delivered it and\n",
      "returned. Jeanne was still sobbing.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'The _patron_,' sobbed Jeanne. 'He--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My angel,' said Paul, 'he is a pig.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was perfectly true. No conscientious judge of character could have\n",
      "denied that Paul had hit the bull's eye. Bredin was a pig. He looked\n",
      "like a pig; he ate like a pig; he grunted like a pig. He had the lavish\n",
      "embonpoint of a pig. Also a porcine soul. If you had tied a bit of blue\n",
      "ribbon round his neck you could have won prizes with him at a show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul's eyes flashed with fury. 'I will slap him in the eye,' he roared.\n",

      "'He called me a tortoise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And kick him in the stomach,' added Paul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeanne's sobs were running on second speed now. The anguish was\n",
      "diminishing. Paul took advantage of the improved conditions to slide an\n",
      "arm part of the way round her waist. In two minutes he had said as much\n",
      "as the ordinary man could have worked off in ten. All good stuff, too.\n",
      "No padding.\n",

      "astounded to be angry.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Listen,' he said. 'At present, yes, it is true, I earn but eighteen\n",
      "shillings a week, but it will not always be so, no. I am not only a\n",
      "waiter. I am also an artist. I have painted a great picture. For a\n",

      "pictures.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time Paul was glad that his arm was no longer round her\n",

      "thumbs. Seven of these in all he visited on that black Thursday, and\n",
      "each of the seven rubbed the surface of the painting with a grimy\n",

      "\n",
      "All that night he lay awake, thinking. It was a weary bundle of nerves\n",
      "that came to the Parisian Cafe next morning. He was late in arriving,\n",
      "which was good in that it delayed the inevitable question as to the\n",
      "fate of the picture, but bad in every other respect. M. Bredin,\n",

      "this took a practical form, though it is on record that in an exuberant\n",
      "moment he once gave a small boy a halfpenny. More frequently it merely\n",
      "led him to soften the porcine austerity of his demeanour. Today,\n",
      "business having been uncommonly good, he felt pleased with the world.\n",
      "He had left his cash-desk and was assailing a bowl of soup at one of\n",
      "the side-tables. Except for a belated luncher at the end of the room\n",
      "the place was empty. It was one of the hours when there was a lull in\n",
      "the proceedings at the Parisian Cafe. Paul was leaning, wrapped in the\n",
      "gloom, against the wall. Jeanne was waiting on the proprietor.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Bredin finished his meal and rose. He felt content. All was well\n",
      "with the world. As he lumbered to his desk he passed Jeanne. He\n",

      "destroy this pig who chucked his Jeanne under the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first intimation M. Bredin had of the declaration of war was the\n",
      "impact of a French roll on his ear. It was one of those nobbly, chunky\n",
      "rolls with sharp corners, almost as deadly as a piece of shrapnel. M.\n",
      "Bredin was incapable of jumping, but he uttered a howl and his vast\n",
      "body quivered like a stricken jelly. A second roll, whizzing by,\n",
      "slapped against the wall. A moment later a cream-bun burst in sticky\n",
      "ruin on the proprietor's left eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The belated luncher had been anxious to pay his bill and go, but he\n",
      "came swiftly to the conclusion that this was worth stopping on for. He\n",
      "leaned back in his chair and watched. M. Bredin had entrenched himself\n",
      "behind the cash-desk, peering nervously at Paul through the cream, and\n",
      "Paul, pouring forth abuse in his native tongue, was brandishing a\n",

      "uncle's hotel. They come, and with them they have brought their pets.\n",
      "Monsieur, it was the existence of a nightmare. Wherever I have looked\n",
      "there are animals. Listen. There is an Indian prince. He has with him\n",
      "two dromedaries. There is also one other Indian prince. With him is a\n",
      "giraffe. The giraffe drink every day one dozen best champagne to keep\n",

      "\n",
      "We artists, monsieur, we are martyrs to our nerves. It became\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We have shaken hands. He is indulgent papa. He has smiled and thanked\n",

      "All is well. Our friendship has progressed with marvellous speed. The\n",

      "'im my dreams of artistic fame, and he has told me 'ow much he dislikes\n",
      "your Lloyd George. He has mentioned that he and Miss Marion depart for\n",
      "London that day. I am desolate. My face tumbles. He has observed my\n",
      "despair. He has invited me to visit them in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine my chagrin. To visit them in London is the one thing I desire\n",
      "to do. But how? I accept gratefully, but I ask myself how it is to be\n",
      "done? I am poor blighter with no profession and nine 'undred francs. He\n",
      "'as taken it for granted that I am wealthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What shall I do? I spend the afternoon trying to form a plan. And then\n",
      "I am resolved. I will go to my uncle and say: 'Uncle, I have the\n",
      "magnificent chance to marry the daughter of wealthy English landowner.\n",
      "Already I 'ave her gratitude. Soon--for I am young, 'andsome,\n",
      "debonair--I shall 'ave her love. Give me one more chance, uncle. Be\n",
      "decent old buck, and put up the money for this affair.'\n",
      "\n",
      "These words I have resolved to say to my uncle.\n",

      "I am crafty. I am diplomat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where else, dear uncle?' I say. 'In all Paris there is no such 'ome\n",

      "\n",
      "The only hotel, I have assured him. The Meurice? _Chut!_ I snap my\n",

      "\n",
      "No, not everyone. Captain Bassett, he does not love me. And why?\n",
      "Because he loves the charming Miss Marion, and observes that already I\n",
      "am succeeding with her like a 'ouse on fire. He is _ami de\n",
      "famille_. He is captain in your Garde Ecossais, and my 'ost told me\n",
      "'e has distinguished himself as soldier pretty much. It may be so. As\n",

      "But, _Chut_! At that moment I would have made the rings round the\n",

      "But I will not weary you, monsieur, with the details of my wooing. You\n",
      "are sympathetic, but I must not weary you. Let us say that I 'ave in\n",
      "four days or five made progress the most remarkable, and proceed to the\n",
      "tragic end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost could I tell it in four words. In them one would say that it is\n",
      "set forth. There was in London at that time popular a song, a comic,\n",
      "vulgar song of the 'Alls, 'The Cat Came Back'. You 'ave 'eard it? Yes?\n",
      "I 'eard it myself, and without emotion. It had no sinister warning for\n",

      "How? I shall tell you. Every word is a sword twisted in my 'eart, but I\n",

      "quality of M. Gandinot's extraordinary countenance was that it induced\n",
      "mirth--not mocking laughter, but a kind of smiling happiness. It\n",
      "possessed that indefinable quality which characterizes the Billiken,\n",

      "_mont-de-piete_ occurring, she had snatched at it. There was a\n",
      "certain fitness in her working there. Business transactions with that\n",
      "useful institution had always been conducted by her, it being Mr\n",
      "Warden's theory that Woman can extract in these crises just that extra\n",

      "Five minutes' walk took her to the Promenade des Anglais, that\n",
      "apparently endless thoroughfare which is Roville's pride. The evening\n",
      "was fine and warm. The sun shone gaily on the white-walled houses, the\n",
      "bright Gardens, and the two gleaming casinos. But Ruth walked\n",

      "sea!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Warden appeared to be in high spirits. He hummed a tune and twirled\n",
      "his cane. He chirruped frequently to Bill, the companion of his walks\n",
      "abroad, a wiry fox-terrier of a demeanour, like his master's, both\n",
      "jaunty and slightly disreputable. An air of gaiety pervaded his\n",

      "\n",

      "good sort. I like him. I had a chat with him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The high spirits were explained. Ruth knew her father. She guessed,\n",
      "correctly, that M. Gandinot, kindest of pawnbrokers, had obliged, in\n",
      "his unofficial capacity, with a trifling loan.\n",
      "\n",

      "acquaintance, and, to the accompaniment of a loud, gargling noise, was\n",
      "endeavouring to bite his head off. The acquaintance, a gentleman of\n",
      "uncertain breed, equally willing, was chewing Bill's paw with the gusto\n",
      "of a gourmet. An Irish terrier, with no personal bias towards either\n",
      "side, was dancing round and attacking each in turn as he came\n",
      "uppermost. And two poodles leaped madly in and out of the melee,\n",
      "barking encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes a better man than Mr Warden to break up a gathering of this\n",
      "kind. The old gentleman was bewildered. He added his voice to the\n",
      "babel, and twice smote Bill grievously with his cane with blows\n",
      "intended for the acquaintance, but beyond that he effected nothing. It\n",
      "seemed probable that the engagement would last till the combatants had\n",
      "consumed each other, after the fashion of the Kilkenny cats, when there\n",
      "suddenly appeared from nowhere a young man in grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is divided into those who can stop dog-fights and those who\n",
      "cannot. The young man in grey belonged to the former class. Within a\n",
      "minute from his entrance on the scene the poodles and the Irish terrier\n",
      "had vanished; the dog of doubtful breed was moving off up the hill,\n",
      "yelping, with the dispatch of one who remembers an important\n",
      "appointment, and Bill, miraculously calmed, was seated in the centre of\n",
      "the Promenade, licking honourable wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Warden was disposed to effervesce with gratitude. The scene had\n",
      "shaken him, and there had been moments when he had given his ankles up\n",
      "for lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't mention it,' said the young man. 'I enjoy arbitrating in these\n",
      "little disputes. Dogs seem to like me and trust my judgement. I\n",
      "consider myself as a sort of honorary dog.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I am bound to say, Mr--?'\n",

      "\n",
      "Ruth inclined her head, and was conscious of a pair of very penetrating\n",
      "brown eyes looking eagerly into hers in a manner which she thoroughly\n",
      "resented. She was not used to the other sex meeting her gaze and\n",
      "holding it as if confident of a friendly welcome. She made up her mind\n",
      "in that instant that this was a young man who required suppression.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've seen you several times out here since I arrived, Miss Warden,'\n",

      "\n",
      "'Really?' said Ruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked away. Her attitude seemed to suggest that she had finished\n",
      "with him, and would be obliged if somebody would come and sweep him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they approached the casino restlessness crept into Mr Warden's\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr Warden started like a war-horse at the sound of the trumpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only it's infallible the wrong way,' went on the young man. 'Well, I\n",
      "wish you luck. I'll see Miss Warden home.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please don't trouble,' said Ruth, in the haughty manner which had\n",

      "\n",
      "It had no such effect on Mr Vince.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Ruth set her teeth. She would see whether he would like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left Mr Warden, who shot in at the casino door like a homing\n",
      "rabbit, and walked on in silence, which lasted till Ruth, suddenly\n",
      "becoming aware that her companion's eyes were fixed on her face, turned\n",
      "her head, to meet a gaze of complete, not to say loving, admiration.\n",
      "She flushed. She was accustomed to being looked at admiringly, but\n",
      "about this particular look there was a subtle quality that\n",
      "distinguished it from the ordinary--something proprietorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Vince appeared to be a young man who wasted no time on conventional\n",
      "conversation-openings.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you believe in affinities, Miss Warden?' he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said Ruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You will before we've done,' said Mr Vince, confidently. 'Why did you\n",
      "try to snub me just now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did I?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You mustn't again. It hurts me. I'm a sensitive man. Diffident. Shy.\n",
      "Miss Warden, will you marry me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth had determined that nothing should shake her from her icy\n",
      "detachment, but this did. She stopped with a gasp, and stared at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Vince reassured her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't expect you to say \"Yes\". That was just a beginning--the shot\n",
      "fired across the bows by way of warning. In you, Miss Warden, I have\n",
      "found my affinity. Have you ever considered this matter of affinities?\n",
      "Affinities are the--the--Wait a moment.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, reflecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I--' began Ruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "''Sh!' said the young man, holding up his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth's eyes flashed. She was not used to having ''Sh!' said to her by\n",
      "young men, and she resented it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've got it,' he declared, with relief. 'I knew I should, but these\n",
      "good things take time. Affinities are the zero on the roulette-board of\n",
      "life. Just as we select a number on which to stake our money, so do we\n",
      "select a type of girl whom we think we should like to marry. And just\n",
      "as zero pops up instead of the number, so does our affinity come along\n",
      "and upset all our pre-conceived notions of the type of girl we should\n",
      "like to marry.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I--' began Ruth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The analogy is in the rough at present. I haven't had time to condense\n",
      "and polish it. But you see the idea. Take my case, for instance. When I\n",
      "saw you a couple of days ago I knew in an instant that you were my\n",
      "affinity. But for years I had been looking for a woman almost your\n",
      "exact opposite. You are dark. Three days ago I couldn't have imagined\n",
      "myself marrying anyone who was not fair. Your eyes are grey. Three days\n",
      "ago my preference for blue eyes was a by-word. You have a shocking\n",
      "temper. Three days ago--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Vince!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There!' said that philosopher, complacently. 'You stamped. The gentle,\n",
      "blue-eyed blonde whom I was looking for three days ago would have\n",
      "drooped timidly. Three days ago my passion for timid droopers amounted\n",
      "to an obsession.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth did not reply. It was useless to bandy words with one who gave\n",
      "such clear evidence of being something out of the common run of\n",
      "word-bandiers. No verbal attack could crush this extraordinary young\n",
      "man. She walked on, all silence and stony profile, uncomfortably\n",
      "conscious that her companion was in no way abashed by the former and\n",
      "was regarding the latter with that frank admiration which had made\n",
      "itself so obnoxious to her before, until they reached their destination.\n",
      "Mr Vince, meanwhile, chatted cheerfully, and pointed out objects of\n",
      "interest by the wayside.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door Ruth permitted herself a word of farewell.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good-bye,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Till tomorrow evening,' said Mr Vince. 'I shall be coming to dinner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Warden ambled home, very happy and contented, two hours later, with\n",
      "half a franc in his pocket, this comparative wealth being due to the\n",
      "fact that the minimum stake permitted by the Roville casino is just\n",
      "double that sum. He was sorry not to have won, but his mind was too\n",
      "full of rosy dreams to permit of remorse. It was the estimable old\n",
      "gentleman's dearest wish that his daughter should marry some rich,\n",
      "open-handed man who would keep him in affluence for the remainder of\n",
      "his days, and to that end he was in the habit of introducing to her\n",
      "notice any such that came his way. There was no question of coercing\n",
      "Ruth. He was too tender-hearted for that. Besides he couldn't. Ruth was\n",
      "not the sort of girl who is readily coerced. He contented himself with\n",
      "giving her the opportunity to inspect his exhibits. Roville is a\n",
      "sociable place, and it was not unusual for him to make friends at the\n",
      "casino and to bring them home, when made, for a cigar. Up to the\n",
      "present, he was bound to admit, his efforts had not been particularly\n",
      "successful. Ruth, he reflected sadly, was a curious girl. She did not\n",
      "show her best side to these visitors. There was no encouragement in her\n",
      "manner. She was apt to frighten the unfortunate exhibits. But of this\n",
      "young man Vince he had brighter hopes. He was rich. That was proved by\n",
      "the very handsome way in which he had behaved in the matter of a small\n",
      "loan when, looking in at the casino after parting from Ruth, he had\n",
      "found Mr Warden in sore straits for want of a little capital to back a\n",
      "brand-new system which he had conceived through closely observing the\n",
      "run of the play. He was also obviously attracted by Ruth. And, as he\n",
      "was remarkably presentable--indeed, quite an unusually good-looking\n",
      "young man--there seemed no reason why Ruth should not be equally\n",
      "attracted by him. The world looked good to Mr Warden as he fell asleep\n",
      "that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth did not fall asleep so easily. The episode had disturbed her. A\n",
      "new element had entered her life, and one that gave promise of\n",
      "producing strange by-products.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, on the following evening, Ruth returned from the stroll on the\n",
      "Promenade which she always took after leaving the _mont-de-piete_,\n",
      "with a feeling of irritation towards things in general, this feeling\n",
      "was not diminished by the sight of Mr Vince, very much at his ease,\n",
      "standing against the mantelpiece of the tiny parlour.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you do?' he said. 'By an extraordinary coincidence I happened\n",
      "to be hanging about outside this house just now, when your father came\n",
      "along and invited me in to dinner. Have you ever thought much about\n",
      "coincidences, Miss Warden? To my mind, they may be described as the\n",
      "zero on the roulette-board of life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He regarded her fondly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'For a shy man, conscious that the girl he loves is inspecting him\n",
      "closely and making up her mind about him,' he proceeded, 'these\n",
      "unexpected meetings are very trying ordeals. You must not form your\n",
      "judgement of me too hastily. You see me now, nervous, embarrassed,\n",
      "tongue-tied. But I am not always like this. Beneath this crust of\n",
      "diffidence there is sterling stuff, Miss Warden. People who know me\n",
      "have spoken of me as a little ray of sun--But here is your father.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Warden was more than usually disappointed with Ruth during dinner.\n",
      "It was the same old story. So far from making herself pleasant to this\n",
      "attractive stranger, she seemed positively to dislike him. She was\n",
      "barely civil to him. With a sigh Mr Warden told himself that he did not\n",
      "understand Ruth, and the rosy dreams he had formed began to fade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth's ideas on the subject of Mr Vince as the days went by were\n",
      "chaotic. Though she told herself that she thoroughly objected to him,\n",
      "he had nevertheless begun to have an undeniable attraction for her. In\n",
      "what this attraction consisted she could not say. When she tried to\n",
      "analyse it, she came to the conclusion that it was due to the fact that\n",
      "he was the only element in her life that made for excitement. Since his\n",
      "advent the days had certainly passed more swiftly for her. The dead\n",
      "level of monotony had been broken. There was a certain fascination in\n",
      "exerting herself to suppress him, which increased daily as each attempt\n",
      "failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Vince put this feeling into words for her. He had a maddening habit\n",
      "of discussing the progress of his courtship in the manner of an\n",
      "impartial lecturer.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am making headway,' he observed. 'The fact that we cannot meet\n",
      "without your endeavouring to plant a temperamental left jab on my\n",
      "spiritual solar plexus encourages me to think that you are beginning at\n",
      "last to understand that we are affinities. To persons of spirit like\n",
      "ourselves the only happy marriage is that which is based on a firm\n",
      "foundation of almost incessant quarrelling. The most beautiful line in\n",
      "English poetry, to my mind, is, \"We fell out, my wife and I.\" You would\n",
      "be wretched with a husband who didn't like you to quarrel with him. The\n",
      "position of affairs now is that I have become necessary to you. If I\n",
      "went out of your life now I should leave an aching void. You would\n",
      "still have that beautiful punch of yours, and there would be nobody to\n",
      "exercise it on. You would pine away. From now on matters should, I\n",
      "think, move rapidly. During the course of the next week I shall\n",
      "endeavour to propitiate you with gifts. Here is the first of them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it her. It was a\n",
      "pencil-sketch, rough and unfinished, but wonderfully clever. Even Ruth\n",
      "could appreciate that--and she was a prejudiced observer, for the\n",
      "sketch was a caricature of herself. It represented her, drawn up to her\n",
      "full height, with enormous, scornful eyes and curling lips, and the\n",
      "artist had managed to combine an excellent likeness while accentuating\n",
      "everything that was marked in what she knew had come to be her normal\n",
      "expression of scorn and discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know you were an artist, Mr Vince,' she said, handing it\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A poor amateur. Nothing more. You may keep it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have not the slightest wish to keep it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You haven't?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is not in the least clever, and it is very impertinent of you to\n",
      "show it to me. The drawing is not funny. It is simply rude.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A little more,' said Mr Vince, 'and I shall begin to think you don't\n",
      "like it. Are you fond of chocolates?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth did not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am sending you some tomorrow.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shall return them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then I shall send some more, and some fruit. Gifts!' soliloquized Mr\n",
      "Vince. 'Gifts! That is the secret. Keep sending gifts. If men would\n",
      "only stick to gifts and quarrelling, there would be fewer bachelors.'\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morrow, as promised, the chocolates arrived, many pounds of them\n",
      "in a lordly box. The bludgeoning of fate had not wholly scotched in\n",
      "Ruth a human weakness for sweets, and it was with a distinct effort\n",
      "that she wrapped the box up again and returned it to the sender. She\n",
      "went off to her work at the _mont-de-piete_ with a glow of\n",
      "satisfaction which comes to those who exhibit an iron will in trying\n",
      "circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the _mont-de-piete_ there occurred a surprising incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprising incidents, as Mr Vince would have said, are the zero on the\n",
      "roulette-board of life. They pop up disturbingly when least expected,\n",
      "confusing the mind and altering pre-conceived opinions. And this was a\n",
      "very surprising incident indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth, as has been stated, sat during her hours of work behind a\n",
      "ground-glass screen, unseen and unseeing. To her the patrons of the\n",
      "establishment were mere disembodied voices--wheedling voices, pathetic\n",
      "voices, voices that protested, voices that hectored, voices that\n",
      "whined, moaned, broke, appealed to the saints, and in various other\n",
      "ways endeavoured to instil into M. Gandinot more spacious and princely\n",
      "views on the subject of advancing money on property pledged. She was\n",
      "sitting behind her screen this morning, scribbling idly on the\n",
      "blotting-pad, for there had been a lull in the business, when the door\n",
      "opened, and the polite, 'Bonjour, monsieur,' of M. Gandinot announced\n",
      "the arrival of another unfortunate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, shaking her like an electric shock, came a voice that she\n",
      "knew--the pleasant voice of Mr Vince.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dialogues that took place on the other side of the screen were\n",
      "often protracted and always sordid, but none had seemed to Ruth so\n",
      "interminable, so hideously sordid, as this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round and round its miserable centre--a silver cigarette-case--the\n",
      "dreary argument circled. The young man pleaded; M. Gandinot, adamant in\n",
      "his official role, was immovable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth could bear it no longer. She pressed her hands over her burning\n",
      "ears, and the voices ceased to trouble her.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with the silence came thought, and a blaze of understanding that\n",
      "flashed upon her and made all things clear. She understood now why she\n",
      "had closed her ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poverty is an acid which reacts differently on differing natures. It\n",
      "had reduced Mr Eugene Warden's self-respect to a minimum. Ruth's it had\n",
      "reared up to an abnormal growth. Her pride had become a weed that ran\n",
      "riot in her soul, darkening it and choking finer emotions. Perhaps it\n",
      "was her father's naive stratagems for the enmeshing of a wealthy\n",
      "husband that had produced in her at last a morbid antipathy to the\n",

      "a woman of spirit, she resented that monarch's somewhat condescending\n",

      "This, she saw now, was what had prejudiced her against George Vince.\n",
      "She had assumed that he was rich. He had conveyed the impression of\n",
      "being rich. And she had been on the defensive against him accordingly.\n",
      "Now, for the first time, she seemed to know him. A barrier had been\n",

      "It had long been Mr Warden's opinion that, if his daughter had a fault,\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr Warden drew in his breath, preparatory to an indignant denial, but\n",
      "he altered his mind and remained silent. As a borrower of money he had\n",
      "every quality but one. He had come to look on her perspicacity in this\n",

      "He stopped, but only for an instant. The next he had darted across the\n",

      "his arms. She clung to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill, the fox-terrier, over whom Mr Vince had happened to stumble, was\n",
      "the first to speak. Almost simultaneously Mr Warden joined in, and\n",
      "there was a striking similarity between the two voices, for Mr Warden,\n",
      "searching for words, emitted as a preliminary to them a sort of\n",
      "passionate yelp.\n",

      "you worry; you're all right.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I refuse!' shouted Mr Warden. 'I absolutely refuse.'\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr Warden's frenzy had cooled. It had been something foreign to his\n",

      "\n",
      "'My personal likes and dislikes,' he said, 'have nothing to do with the\n",
      "matter, Mr Vince. They are beside the point. I have my daughter to\n",
      "consider. I cannot allow her to marry a man without a penny.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Quite right,' said Mr Vince, approvingly. 'Don't have anything to do\n",
      "with the fellow. If he tries to butt in, send for the police.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Warden hesitated. He had always been a little ashamed of Ruth's\n",

      "always somewhere about, waiting to pop up. Have you ever heard of\n",
      "Vince's Stores, Mr Warden? Perhaps they are since your time. Well, my\n",
      "father is the proprietor. One of our specialities is children's toys,\n",
      "but we haven't picked a real winner for years, and my father when I\n",

      "Billiken, only better, was what he felt he needed. I'm not used to\n",
      "brain work, and after a spell of it I felt I wanted a rest. I came here\n",
      "to recuperate, and the very first morning I got an inspiration. You may\n",
      "have noticed that the manager of the _mont-de-piete_ here isn't\n",
      "strong on conventional good looks. I saw him at the casino, and the\n",

      "He pressed Ruth's hand affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I lost track of him, and it was only the day before yesterday that I\n",
      "discovered who he was and where he was to be found. Well, you can't go\n",
      "up to a man and ask him to pose as a model for Uncle Zip, the\n",
      "Hump-Curer. The only way to get sittings was to approach him in the\n",
      "way of business. So I collected what property I had and waded in.\n",
      "That's the whole story. Do I pass?'\n",
      "\n",

      "and now the sun of his smile shone out warmly. He gripped Mr Vince's\n",
      "hand with every evidence of esteem, and after that he did what was\n",
      "certainly the best thing, by passing gently from the room. On his face,\n",
      "as he went, was a look such as Moses might have worn on the summit of\n",
      "Pisgah.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some twenty minutes later that Ruth made a remark.\n",

      "very kind to me.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Archibald Mealing was one of those golfers in whom desire outruns\n",
      "performance. Nobody could have been more willing than Archibald. He\n",
      "tried, and tried hard. Every morning before he took his bath he would\n",
      "stand in front of his mirror and practise swings. Every night before he\n",
      "went to bed he would read the golden words of some master on the\n",
      "subject of putting, driving, or approaching. Yet on the links most of\n",
      "his time was spent in retrieving lost balls or replacing America.\n",
      "Whether it was that Archibald pressed too much or pressed too little,\n",
      "whether it was that his club deviated from the dotted line which joined\n",
      "the two points A and B in the illustrated plate of the man making the\n",
      "brassy shot in the _Hints on Golf_ book, or whether it was that he\n",
      "was pursued by some malignant fate, I do not know. Archibald rather\n",
      "favoured the last theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important point is that, in his thirty-first year, after six\n",
      "seasons of untiring effort, Archibald went in for a championship, and\n",
      "won it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Archibald, mark you, whose golf was a kind of blend of hockey, Swedish\n",
      "drill, and buck-and-wing dancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the ordeal I must face when I make such a statement. I see\n",
      "clearly before me the solid phalanx of men from Missouri, some urging\n",
      "me to tell it to the King of Denmark, others insisting that I produce\n",
      "my Eskimos. Nevertheless, I do not shrink. I state once more that in\n",
      "his thirty-first year Archibald Mealing went in for a golf\n",
      "championship, and won it.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Archibald belonged to a select little golf club, the members of which\n",
      "lived and worked in New York, but played in Jersey. Men of substance,\n",
      "financially as well as physically, they had combined their superfluous\n",
      "cash and with it purchased a strip of land close to the sea. This land\n",
      "had been drained--to the huge discomfort of a colony of mosquitoes\n",
      "which had come to look on the place as their private property--and\n",
      "converted into links, which had become a sort of refuge for incompetent\n",
      "golfers. The members of the Cape Pleasant Club were easygoing refugees\n",
      "from other and more exacting clubs, men who pottered rather than raced\n",
      "round the links; men, in short, who had grown tired of having to stop\n",
      "their game and stand aside in order to allow perspiring experts to whiz\n",
      "past them. The Cape Pleasant golfers did not make themselves slaves to\n",
      "the game. Their language, when they foozled, was gently regretful\n",
      "rather than sulphurous. The moment in the day's play which they enjoyed\n",
      "most was when they were saying: 'Well, here's luck!' in the club-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will, therefore, be readily understood that Archibald's inability to\n",
      "do a hole in single figures did not handicap him at Cape Pleasant as it\n",
      "might have done at St. Andrews. His kindly clubmates took him to their\n",
      "bosoms to a man, and looked on him as a brother. Archibald's was one of\n",
      "those admirable natures which prompt their possessor frequently to\n",
      "remark: 'These are on me!' and his fellow golfers were not slow to\n",
      "appreciate the fact. They all loved Archibald.\n",
      "\n",
      "Archibald was on the floor of his bedroom one afternoon, picking up the\n",
      "fragments of his mirror--a friend had advised him to practise the\n",
      "Walter J. Travis lofting shot--when the telephone bell rang. He took up\n",
      "the receiver, and was hailed by the comfortable voice of McCay, the\n",
      "club secretary.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that Mealing?' asked McCay. 'Say, Archie, I'm putting your name\n",
      "down for our championship competition. That's right, isn't it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure,' said Archibald. 'When does it start?'\n",

      "'Next Saturday.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's me.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The wire hummed with McCay's congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thanks,' said Archibald. 'Thanks, old man. What? Oh, yes. Milsom's her\n",
      "name. By the way, her family have taken a cottage at Cape Pleasant for\n",
      "the summer. Some distance from the links. Yes, very convenient, isn't\n",
      "it? Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He hung up the receiver and resumed his task of gathering up the\n",
      "fragments. Now McCay happened to be of a romantic and sentimental\n",
      "nature. He was by profession a chartered accountant, and inclined to be\n",
      "stout; and all rather stout chartered accountants are sentimental.\n",
      "McCay was the sort of man who keeps old ball programmes and bundles of\n",
      "letters tied round with lilac ribbon. At country houses, where they\n",
      "lingered in the porch after dinner to watch the moonlight flooding the\n",
      "quiet garden, it was McCay and his colleague who lingered longest.\n",
      "McCay knew Ella Wheeler Wilcox by heart, and could take Browning\n",
      "without anaesthetics. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that\n",
      "Archibald's remark about his fiancee coming to live at Cape Pleasant\n",
      "should give him food for thought. It appealed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reflected on it a good deal during the day, and, running across\n",
      "Sigsbee, a fellow Cape Pleasanter, after dinner that night at the\n",
      "Sybarites' Club, he spoke of the matter to him. It so happened that\n",
      "both had dined excellently, and were looking on the world with a sort\n",
      "of cosy benevolence. They were in the mood when men pat small boys on\n",
      "the head and ask them if they mean to be President when they grow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I called up Archie Mealing today,' said McCay. 'Did you know he was\n",
      "engaged?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I did hear something about it. Girl of the name of Wilson, or--'\n",
      "\n",

      "me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then she'll have a chance of seeing him play in the championship\n",
      "competition.'\n",
      "\n",
      "McCay sucked his cigar in silence for a while, watching with dreamy\n",
      "eyes the blue smoke as it curled ceiling-ward. When he spoke his voice\n",
      "was singularly soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know, Sigsbee,' he said, sipping his Maraschino with a gentle\n",
      "melancholy--'do you know, there is something wonderfully pathetic to me\n",
      "in this business. I see the whole thing so clearly. There was a kind of\n",
      "quiver in the poor old chap's voice when he said: \"She is coming to\n",
      "Cape Pleasant,\" which told me more than any words could have done. It\n",
      "is a tragedy in its way, Sigsbee. We may smile at it, think it trivial;\n",
      "but it is none the less a tragedy. That warm-hearted, enthusiastic\n",
      "girl, all eagerness to see the man she loves do well--Archie, poor old\n",
      "Archie, all on fire to prove to her that her trust in him is not\n",
      "misplaced, and the end--Disillusionment--Disappointment--Unhappiness.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He ought to keep his eye on the ball,' said the more practical\n",
      "Sigsbee.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Quite possibly,' continued McCay, 'he has told her that he will win\n",
      "this championship.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If Archie's mutt enough to have told her that,' said Sigsbee\n",
      "decidedly, 'he deserves all he gets. Waiter, two Scotch highballs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "McCay was in no mood to subscribe to this stony-hearted view.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I tell you,' he said, 'I'm _sorry_ for Archie! I'm _sorry_\n",
      "for the poor old chap. And I'm more than sorry for the girl.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I don't see what we can do,' said Sigsbee. 'We can hardly be\n",
      "expected to foozle on purpose, just to let Archie show off before his\n",
      "girl.'\n",
      "\n",
      "McCay paused in the act of lighting his cigar, as one smitten with a\n",
      "great thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why not?' he said. 'Why not, Sigsbee? Sigsbee, you've hit it.'\n",

      "\n",
      "Sigsbee's benevolence was expanding under the influence of the Scotch\n",

      "a cigar, there a lunch, at another time seats for the theatre, began to\n",
      "rise to the surface of his memory like rainbow-coloured bubbles. He\n",
      "wavered.\n",
      "\n",

      "Archibald's. At the next hole the improvement was not marked enough to\n",
      "have its full effect, and Archibald contrived to halve. This made him\n",
      "two up and three to play. What the average golfer would consider a\n",
      "commanding lead. But Archibald was no average golfer. A commanding\n",
      "lead for him would have been two up and one to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give the public of his best, your golfer should have his mind cool\n",
      "and intent upon the game. Inasmuch as Gossett was worrying about the\n",
      "telegrams, while Archibald, strive as he might to dismiss it, was\n",
      "haunted by a vision of Margaret standing alone and deserted on the\n",
      "board-walk, play became, as it were, ragged. Fine putting enabled\n",
      "Gossett to do the sixteenth hole in twelve, and when, winning the\n",
      "seventeenth in nine, he brought his score level with Archibald's the\n",
      "match seemed over. But just then--\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Gossett!' said a familiar voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more was the much-enduring telegraph boy among those present.\n",
      "\n",
      "'T'ree dis time!' he observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett sprang, but again the watchful Sigsbee was too swift.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Be brave, Gossett--be brave,' he said. 'This is a crisis in the game.\n",
      "Keep your nerve. Play just as if nothing existed outside the links. To\n",
      "look at these telegrams now would be fatal.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Eye-witnesses of that great encounter will tell the story of the last\n",
      "hole to their dying day. It was one of those Titanic struggles which\n",
      "Time cannot efface from the memory. Archibald was fortunate in getting\n",
      "a good start. He only missed twice before he struck his ball on the\n",
      "tee. Gossett had four strokes ere he achieved the feat. Nor did\n",
      "Archibald's luck desert him in the journey to the green. He was out of\n",
      "the bunker in eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett emerged only after sixteen. Finally, when Archibald's\n",
      "twenty-first stroke sent the ball trickling into the hole, Gossett\n",
      "had played his thirtieth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ball had hardly rested on the bottom of the hole before Gossett had\n",
      "begun to tear the telegrams from their envelopes. As he read, his eyes\n",
      "bulged in their sockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not bad news, I hope,' said a sympathetic bystander.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sigsbee took the sheaf of telegrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first ran: 'Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.' The second also ran:\n",
      "'Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.' So, singularly enough, did the third,\n",
      "fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Great Scott!' said Sigsbee. 'He seems to have been pretty anxious not\n",
      "to run any risk of missing you, Gossett.'\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, Archibald, close beside him, was looking at his watch. The\n",
      "hands stood at a quarter to two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret and her mother were seated in the parlour when Archibald\n",
      "arrived. Mrs Milsom, who had elicited the fact that Archibald had not\n",
      "kept his appointment, had been saying 'I told you so' for some time,\n",
      "and this had not improved Margaret's temper. When, therefore,\n",
      "Archibald, damp and dishevelled, was shown in, the chill in the air\n",
      "nearly gave him frost-bite. Mrs Milsom did her celebrated imitation of\n",
      "the Gorgon, while Margaret, lightly humming an air, picked up a weekly\n",
      "paper and became absorbed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Margaret, let me explain,' panted Archibald. Mrs Milsom was understood\n",

      "fashion plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Driving in a taximeter to the ferry this morning,' resumed Archibald,\n",
      "'I had an accident.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the result of some rather feverish brain-work on the way from\n",
      "the links to the cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The periodical flopped to the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, Archie, are you hurt?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A few scratches, nothing more; but it made me miss my train.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What train did you catch?' asked Mrs Milsom sepulchrally.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The one o'clock. I came straight on here from the station.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said Margaret, 'Stuyvesant was coming home on the one o'clock\n",
      "train. Did you see him?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Archibald's jaw dropped slightly.\n",

      "\n",
      "'How curious,' said Margaret.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Thought I should find you here, Mealing,' he said. 'They gave me this\n",
      "at the station to give to you; you dropped it this morning when you got\n",
      "out of the train.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He handed Archibald the missing pouch.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thanks,' said the latter huskily. 'When you say this morning, of course\n",
      "you mean this afternoon, but thanks all the same--thanks--thanks.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, Archibald Mealing, he does _not_ mean this afternoon,' said\n",
      "Mrs Milsom. 'Stuyvesant, speak! From what train did that guf--did Mr\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Although this story is concerned principally with the Man and the Maid,\n",
      "the Miasma pervades it to such an extent that I feel justified in\n",
      "putting his name on the bills. Webster's Dictionary gives the meaning\n",
      "of the word 'miasma' as 'an infection floating in the air; a deadly\n",
      "exhalation'; and, in the opinion of Mr Robert Ferguson, his late\n",
      "employer, that description, though perhaps a little too flattering, on\n",
      "the whole summed up Master Roland Bean pretty satisfactorily. Until the\n",
      "previous day he had served Mr Ferguson in the capacity of office-boy;\n",
      "but there was that about Master Bean which made it practically\n",
      "impossible for anyone to employ him for long. A syndicate of Galahad,\n",
      "Parsifal, and Marcus Aurelius might have done it, but to an ordinary\n",
      "erring man, conscious of things done which should not have been done,\n",
      "and other things equally numerous left undone, he was too oppressive.\n",
      "One conscience is enough for any man. The employer of Master Bean had\n",
      "to cringe before two. Nobody can last long against an office-boy whose\n",
      "eyes shine with quiet, respectful reproof through gold-rimmed\n",
      "spectacles, whose manner is that of a middle-aged saint, and who\n",
      "obviously knows all the Plod and Punctuality books by heart and orders\n",
      "his life by their precepts. Master Bean was a walking edition of\n",
      "_Stepping-Stones to Success, Millionaires who Have Never Smoked_,\n",
      "and _Young Man, Get up Early_. Galahad, Parsifal, and Marcus\n",
      "Aurelius, as I say, might have remained tranquil in his presence, but\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet now he was sitting in his office, long after the last clerk had\n",

      "\n",
      "Was this remorse? Was he longing for the touch of the vanished hand,\n",
      "the gleam of the departed spectacles? He was not. His mind was full of\n",
      "Master Bean because Master Bean was waiting for him in the outer\n",
      "office; and he lingered on at his desk, after the day's work was done,\n",
      "for the same reason. Word had been brought to him earlier in the\n",
      "evening, that Master Roland Bean would like to see him. The answer to\n",
      "that was easy: 'Tell him I'm busy.' Master Bean's admirably dignified\n",
      "reply was that he understood how great was the pressure of Mr\n",
      "Ferguson's work, and that he would wait till he was at liberty.\n",
      "Liberty! Talk of the liberty of the treed possum, but do not use the\n",

      "guarding the only exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Ferguson kicked the waste-paper basket savagely. The unfairness of\n",
      "the thing hurt him. A sacked office-boy ought to stay sacked. He had no\n",

      "playing the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader may wonder what was the trouble--why Mr Ferguson could not\n",

      "broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight cough penetrated the door between the two offices. Mr Ferguson\n",
      "rose and grabbed his hat. Perhaps a sudden rush--he shot out with the\n",

      "'The porter closes the door at seven o'clock punctually, sir. It is now\n",
      "nearly twenty minutes after the hour.'\n",

      "\n",

      "sir, that I am extremely anxious to give satisfaction. If you would\n",

      "Mr Ferguson stared at him in dumb horror. He had a momentary vision of\n",
      "a sleepless night spent in listening to a nicely-polished speech for\n",
      "the defence. He was seized with a mad desire for flight. He could not\n",
      "leave the building, but he must get away somewhere and think.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dashed from the room and raced up the dark stairs. And as he arrived\n",
      "at the next floor his eye was caught by a thin pencil of light which\n",

      "\n",
      "No shipwrecked mariner on a desert island could have welcomed the\n",
      "appearance of a sail with greater enthusiasm. He bounded at the door.\n",
      "He knew to whom the room belonged. It was the office of one Blaythwayt;\n",
      "and Blaythwayt was not only an acquaintance, but a sportsman. Quite\n",
      "possibly there might be a pack of cards on Blaythwayt's person to help\n",
      "pass the long hours. And if not, at least he would be company and his\n",
      "office a refuge. He flung open the door without going through the\n",
      "formality of knocking. Etiquette is not for the marooned.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He looked at her with unwilling respect, the respect of the novice for\n",
      "the veteran. She was nothing to him now, of course. She had passed out\n",
      "of his life. But he could not help remembering that long ago--eighteen\n",
      "months ago--what he had admired most in her had been this same spirit,\n",
      "this game refusal to be disturbed by Fate's blows. It braced him up.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'I don't force my conversation on anyone.'\n",

      "Reared in the country, he had developed at an early age a fine, healthy\n",

      "squealing frantically for cocoa. Would it not be better to--no, a\n",
      "thousand times no! Death, but not surrender. His self-respect was at\n",
      "stake. Looking back, he saw that his entire relations with this girl\n",

      "thought--an express train bound for the Land of Yesterday. It recalled\n",
      "days in the woods, evenings on the lawn. It recalled sunshine--storm.\n",
      "Plenty of storm. Minor tempests that burst from a clear sky, apparently\n",
      "without cause, and the great final tornado. There had been cause enough\n",
      "for that. Why was it, mused Mr Ferguson, that every girl in every\n",
      "country town in every county of England who had ever recited 'Curfew\n",
      "shall not ring tonight' well enough to escape lynching at the hands of\n",

      "\n",
      "The Present had little charm, but at least it was better than the\n",
      "cakeless Future. He fixed his thoughts on it. He wondered how Master\n",
      "Bean was passing the time. Probably doing deep-breathing exercises, or\n",
      "reading a pocket Aristotle. The girl pushed back her chair and rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went to a small cupboard in the corner of the room, and from it\n",
      "produced in instalments all that goes to make cake and cocoa. She did\n",
      "not speak. Presently, filling Space, there sprang into being an Odour;\n",
      "and as it reached him Mr Ferguson stiffened in his chair, bracing\n",
      "himself as for a fight to the death. It was more than an odour. It was\n",
      "the soul of the cocoa singing to him. His fingers gripped the arms of\n",
      "the chair. This was the test.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was pitch dark on the landing. He stepped aside, and they passed\n",

      "\n",
      "he had gathered roughly, as it were, that Simeon had not been\n",
      "comfortable. He had pitied him. But now, sitting in his office-chair,\n",
      "he began to wonder what the man had made such a fuss about. He\n",
      "suspected him of having had a touch of the white feather in him. It was\n",
      "not as if he had not had food. He talked about 'hungers and thirsts',\n",
      "but he must have had something to eat, or he could not have stayed the\n",
      "course. Very likely, if the truth were known, there was somebody below\n",
      "who passed him up regular supplies of cake and cocoa.\n",

      "aches, stitches, not to mention cramps, that he had experienced could\n",
      "not possibly have been condensed into a shorter period--that his manly\n",
      "spirit snapped. Let us not judge him too harshly. The girl upstairs had\n",
      "broken his heart, ruined his life, and practically compared him to\n",
      "Roland Bean, and his pride should have built up an impassable wall\n",
      "between them, but--she had cake and cocoa. In similar circumstances\n",

      "dumb. An instant before and he had had but a desperate hope of winning\n",
      "these priceless things from her at the cost of all his dignity and\n",
      "self-respect. He had been prepared to secure them through a shower of\n",
      "biting taunts, a blizzard of razor-like 'I told you so's'. Yet here he\n",

      "any longer by the standards of a country town. London has knocked some\n",

      "'Absolutely certain. Didn't she come in to lunch?'\n",
      "\n",

      "haven't seen her all day. I thought she must be out with the guns.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Keith was a man who had built up a large fortune mainly by\n",
      "consistently refusing to allow anything to agitate him. He carried this\n",
      "policy into private life.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Wasn't she in at lunch?' he asked, placidly.\n",
      "\n",

      "anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am not good at riddles,' said Mr Keith, comfortably, 'but I can\n",
      "answer that one. I would not put back dinner. I would not put back\n",
      "dinner for the King.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsa did not come back for dinner. Nor was hers the only vacant place.\n",
      "Mr Barstowe had also vanished. Even Mr Keith's calm was momentarily\n",
      "ruffled by this discovery. The poet was not a favourite of his--it was\n",
      "only reluctantly that he had consented to his being invited at all; and\n",
      "the presumption being that when two members of a house-party disappear\n",
      "simultaneously they are likely to be spending the time in each other's\n",
      "society, he was annoyed. Elsa was not the girl to make a fool of\n",
      "herself, of course, but--He was unwontedly silent at dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Keith's anxiety displayed itself differently. She was frankly\n",
      "worried, and mentioned it. By the time the fish had been reached\n",
      "conversation at the table had fixed itself definitely on the one\n",
      "topic.\n",

      "'It isn't the car this time, at any rate,' said Mr Keith. 'It hasn't\n",
      "been out today.'\n",

      "that was the farthest point reached in the investigation of the\n",
      "mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time dinner was over a spirit of unrest was abroad. The company\n",
      "sat about in uneasy groups. Snooker-pool was, if not forgotten, at any\n",
      "rate shelved. Somebody suggested search-parties, and one or two of the\n",
      "moustache-tuggers wandered rather aimlessly out into the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was standing in the porch with Mr Keith when Keggs approached.\n",
      "As his eyes lit on him, Martin was conscious of a sudden solidifying of\n",
      "the vague suspicion which had been forming in his mind. And yet that\n",
      "suspicion seemed so wild. How could Keggs, with the worst intentions,\n",
      "have had anything to do with this? He could not forcibly have abducted\n",
      "the missing pair and kept them under lock and key. He could not have\n",
      "stunned them and left them in a ditch. Nevertheless, looking at him\n",
      "standing there in his attitude of deferential dignity, with the light\n",
      "from the open door shining on his bald head, Martin felt perfectly\n",
      "certain that he had in some mysterious fashion engineered the whole\n",

      "a picturesque strip of water, some fifteen hundred yards in width and a\n",
      "little less in length, in the centre of which stood a small and densely\n",
      "wooded island. It was a favourite haunt of visitors at the house when\n",

      "room, he put the fitting-out of the relief ship into the good hands of\n",
      "a group of his fellow guests whom he discovered in the porch. Elsa's\n",
      "feelings towards her rescuer might be one of unmixed gratitude; but it\n",
      "might, on the other hand, be one of resentment. He did not wish her to\n",
      "connect him in her mind with the episode in any way whatsoever. Martin\n",
      "had once released a dog from a trap, and the dog had bitten him. He had\n",
      "been on an errand of mercy, but the dog had connected him with his\n",

      "twiddling his fingers. At one period of his career, before the\n",
      "influence of his uncle Henry had placed him in the London and Suburban\n",
      "Bank, Owen had been an actor. On the strength of a batting average of\n",
      "thirty-three point nought seven for Middlesex, he had been engaged by\n",
      "the astute musical-comedy impresario to whom the idea first occurred\n",
      "that, if you have got to have young men to chant 'We are merry and gay,\n",

      "From the very start, from the moment when he revealed the fact that his\n",

      "deplorable situation possible; but he felt that it would have been in\n",
      "better taste for the young man to have effaced himself and behaved more\n",
      "like a bank-clerk and less like an heir.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am exceedingly sorry for this, Mr Bentley,' he said, 'but you will\n",
      "understand that I cannot--It is, of course, out of the question. It\n",
      "would be best, in the circumstances, I think, if you did not see my\n",
      "daughter again--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She's waiting in the passage outside,' said Owen, simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--after today. Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen left the room. Audrey was hovering in the neighbourhood of the\n",
      "door. She came quickly up to him, and his spirits rose, as they always\n",
      "did, at the sight of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well?' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No good,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey considered the problem for a moment, and was rewarded with an\n",
      "idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Shall I go in and cry?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It wouldn't be of any use.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell me what happened.'\n",
      "\n",

      "'He didn't mean it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He thinks he did.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey reflected.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We shall simply have to keep writing, then. And we can talk on the\n",
      "telephone. That isn't seeing each other. Has your bank a telephone?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes. But--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's all right, then. I'll ring you up every day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish I could make some money,' said Owen, thoughtfully. 'But I seem\n",
      "to be one of those chaps who can't. Nothing I try comes off. I've never\n",
      "drawn anything except a blank in a sweep. I spent about two pounds on\n",
      "sixpenny postal orders when the Limerick craze was on, and didn't win a\n",
      "thing. Once when I was on tour I worked myself to a shadow, dramatizing\n",
      "a novel. Nothing came of that, either.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What novel?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A thing called _White Roses,_ by a woman named Edith Butler.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey looked up quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I suppose you knew her very well? Were you great friends?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know her at all. I'd never met her. I just happened to buy\n",
      "the thing at a bookstall, and thought it would make a good play. I\n",
      "expect it was pretty bad rot. Anyhow, she never took the trouble to\n",
      "send it back or even to acknowledge receipt.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps she never got it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I registered it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She was a cat,' said Audrey, decidedly. 'I'm glad of it, though. If\n",
      "another woman had helped you make a lot of money, I should have died of\n",
      "jealousy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Routine is death to heroism. For the first few days after his parting\n",
      "with Mr Sheppherd, Owen was in heroic mood, full of vaguely dashing\n",
      "schemes, regarding the world as his oyster, and burning to get at it,\n",
      "sword in hand. But routine, with its ledgers and its copying-ink and\n",
      "its customers, fell like a grey cloud athwart his horizon, blotting out\n",
      "rainbow visions of sudden wealth, dramatically won. Day by day the glow\n",
      "faded and hopelessness grew.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the glow did not entirely fade it was due to Audrey, who more than\n",
      "fulfilled her promise of ringing him up on the telephone. She rang him\n",
      "up at least once, frequently several times, every day, a fact which was\n",
      "noted and commented upon in a harshly critical spirit by the head of\n",
      "his department, a man with no soul and a strong objection to doing his\n",
      "subordinates' work for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule, her conversation, though pleasing, was discursive and lacked\n",
      "central motive, but one morning she had genuine news to impart.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Owen'--her voice was excited--'have you seen the paper today? Then\n",
      "listen. I'll read it out. Are you listening? This is what it says: \"The\n",
      "Piccadilly Theatre will reopen shortly with a dramatized version of\n",
      "Miss Edith Butler's popular novel, _White Roses_, prepared by the\n",
      "authoress herself. A strong cast is being engaged, including--\" And\n",
      "then a lot of names. What are you going to do about it, Owen?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What am I going to do?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you see what's happened? That awful woman has stolen your play.\n",
      "She has waited all these years, hoping you would forget. What are you\n",
      "laughing at?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wasn't laughing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, you were. It tickled my ear. I'll ring off if you do it again.\n",
      "You don't believe me. Well, you wait and see if I'm not--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Edith Butler's incapable of such a thing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a slight pause at the other end of the wire.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you said you didn't know her,' said Audrey, jealously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't--I don't,' said Owen, hastily. 'But I've read her books.\n",
      "They're simply chunks of superfatted sentiment. She's a sort of\n",
      "literary onion. She compels tears. A woman like that couldn't steal a\n",
      "play if she tried.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can't judge authors from their books. You must go and see the play\n",
      "when it comes on. Then you'll see I'm right. I'm absolutely certain\n",
      "that woman is trying to swindle you. Don't laugh in that horrid way.\n",
      "Very well, I told you I should ring off, and now I'm going to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of the next month Owen's annual holiday arrived. The\n",
      "authorities of the London and Suburban Bank were no niggards. They\n",
      "recognized that a man is not a machine. They gave their employees ten\n",
      "days in the year in which to tone up their systems for another twelve\n",
      "months' work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen spent his boyhood in the Shropshire village of which his father\n",
      "had been rector, and thither he went when his holiday came round, to\n",
      "the farm of one Dorman. He was glad of the chance to get to Shropshire.\n",
      "There is something about the country there, with its green fields and\n",
      "miniature rivers, that soothes the wounded spirit and forms a pleasant\n",
      "background for sentimental musings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was comfortable at the farm. The household consisted of Mr Dorman,\n",
      "an old acquaintance, his ten-year-old son George, and Mr Dorman's\n",
      "mother, an aged lady with a considerable local reputation as a wise\n",
      "woman. Rumour had it that the future held no mysteries for her, and it\n",
      "was known that she could cure warts, bruised fingers, and even the\n",
      "botts by means of spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except for these, Owen had fancied that he was alone in the house. It\n",
      "seemed not, however. There was a primeval piano in his sitting-room,\n",
      "and on the second morning it suited his mood to sit down at this and\n",
      "sing 'Asthore', the fruity pathos of which ballad appealed to him\n",
      "strongly at this time, accompanying himself by an ingenious arrangement\n",
      "in three chords. He had hardly begun, however, when Mr Dorman appeared,\n",
      "somewhat agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you don't mind, Mr Owen,' he said. 'I forgot to tell you. There's a\n",
      "lit'ery gent boarding with me in the room above, and he can't bear to\n",
      "be disturbed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A muffled stamping from the ceiling bore out his words.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Writing a book he is,' continued Mr Dorman. 'He caught young George a\n",
      "clip over the ear-'ole yesterday for blowing his trumpet on the stairs.\n",
      "Gave him sixpence afterwards, and said he'd skin him if he ever did it\n",
      "again. So, if you don't mind--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, all right,' said Owen. 'Who is he?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Gentleman of the name of Prosser.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen could not recollect having come across any work by anyone of that\n",
      "name; but he was not a wide reader; and, whether the man above was a\n",
      "celebrity or not, he was entitled to quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never heard of him,' he said, 'but that's no reason why I should\n",
      "disturb him. Let him rip. I'll cut out the musical effects in future.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The days passed smoothly by. The literary man remained invisible,\n",
      "though occasionally audible, tramping the floor in the frenzy of\n",
      "composition. Nor, until the last day of his visit, did Owen see old Mrs\n",
      "Dorman.\n",
      "\n",
      "That she was not unaware of his presence in the house, however, was\n",
      "indicated on the last morning. He was smoking an after-breakfast pipe\n",
      "at the open window and waiting for the dog-cart that was to take him to\n",
      "the station, when George, the son of the house, entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "George stood in the doorway, grinned, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Farsezjerligranmatellyerforchbythecards?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Eh?' said Owen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth repeated the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second repetition light began to creep in. A boyhood spent in\n",
      "the place, added to this ten days' stay, had made Owen something of a\n",
      "linguist.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father says would I like grandma to do what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell yer forch'n by ther cards.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where is she?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Backyarnder.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen followed him into the kitchen, where he found Mr Dorman, the\n",
      "farmer, and, seated at the table, fumbling with a pack of cards, an old\n",
      "woman, whom he remembered well.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mother wants to tell your fortune,' said Mr Dorman, in a hoarse aside.\n",
      "'She always will tell visitors' fortunes. She told Mr Prosser's, and he\n",
      "didn't half like it, because she said he'd be engaged in two months and\n",
      "married inside the year. He said wild horses wouldn't make him do it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She can tell me that if she likes. I shan't object.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mother, here's Mr Owen.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I seed him fast enough,' said the old woman, briskly. 'Shuffle, an' cut\n",
      "three times.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She then performed mysterious manoeuvres with the cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I see pots o' money,' announced the sibyl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If she says it, it's there right enough,' said her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "'She means my bonus,' said Owen. 'But that's only ten pounds. And I lose\n",
      "it if I'm late twice more before Christmas.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It'll come sure enough.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pots,' said the old woman, and she was still mumbling the encouraging\n",
      "word when Owen left the kitchen and returned to the sitting-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed rather ruefully. At that moment he could have found a use\n",
      "for pots o' money.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked to the window, and looked out. It was a glorious morning. The\n",
      "heat-mist was dancing over the meadow beyond the brook, and from the\n",
      "farmyard came the liquid charawks of care-free fowls. It seemed wicked\n",
      "to leave these haunts of peace for London on such a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "An acute melancholy seized him. Absently, he sat down at the piano. The\n",
      "prejudices of literary Mr Prosser had slipped from his mind. Softly at\n",
      "first, then gathering volume as the spirit of the song gripped him, he\n",
      "began to sing 'Asthore'. He became absorbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just, for the sixth time, won through to 'Iyam-ah waiting for-er\n",
      "theeee-yass-thorre,' and was doing some intricate three-chord work\n",
      "preparatory to starting over again, when a loaf of bread whizzed past\n",
      "his ear. It missed him by an inch, and crashed against a plaster\n",
      "statuette of the Infant Samuel on the top of the piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a standard loaf, containing eighty per cent of semolina, and it\n",
      "practically wiped the Infant Samuel out of existence. At the same\n",
      "moment, at his back, there sounded a loud, wrathful snort.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spun round. The door was open, and at the other side of the table\n",
      "was standing a large, black-bearded, shirt-sleeved man, in an attitude\n",
      "rather reminiscent of Ajax defying the lightning. His hands trembled.\n",
      "His beard bristled. His eyes gleamed ferociously beneath enormous\n",
      "eyebrows. As Owen turned, he gave tongue in a voice like the discharge\n",
      "of a broadside.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stop it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen's mind, wrenched too suddenly from the dreamy future to the vivid\n",
      "present, was not yet completely under control. He gaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stop--that--infernal--noise!' roared the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shot through the door, banging it after him, and pounded up the\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen was annoyed. The artistic temperament was all very well, but\n",
      "there were limits. It was absurd that obscure authors should behave in\n",
      "this way. Prosser! Who on earth was Prosser? Had anyone ever heard of\n",
      "him? No! Yet here he was going about the country clipping small boys\n",
      "over the ear-hole, and flinging loaves of bread at bank-clerks as if he\n",
      "were Henry James or Marie Corelli. Owen reproached himself bitterly for\n",
      "his momentary loss of presence of mind. If he had only kept his head,\n",
      "he could have taken a flying shot at the man with the marmalade-pot. It\n",
      "had been within easy reach. Instead of which, he had merely stood and\n",
      "gaped. Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, 'It\n",
      "might have been.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His manly regret was interrupted by the entrance of Mr Dorman with the\n",
      "information that the dog-cart was at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey was out of town when Owen arrived in London, but she returned a\n",
      "week later. The sound of her voice through the telephone did much to\n",
      "cure the restlessness from which he had been suffering since the\n",
      "conclusion of his holiday. But the thought that she was so near yet so\n",
      "inaccessible produced in him a meditative melancholy which enveloped\n",
      "him like a cloud that would not lift. His manner became distrait. He\n",
      "lost weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "If customers were not vaguely pained by his sad, pale face, it was only\n",
      "because the fierce rush of modern commercial life leaves your business\n",
      "man little leisure for observing pallor in bank-clerks. What did pain\n",
      "them was the gentle dreaminess with which he performed his duties. He\n",
      "was in the Inward Bills Department, one of the features of which was\n",
      "the sudden inrush, towards the end of each afternoon, of hatless,\n",
      "energetic young men with leather bags strapped to their left arms,\n",
      "clamouring for mysterious crackling documents, much fastened with pins.\n",
      "Owen had never quite understood what it was that these young men did\n",
      "want, and now his detached mind refused even more emphatically to\n",
      "grapple with the problem. He distributed the documents at random with\n",
      "the air of a preoccupied monarch scattering largess to the mob, and the\n",
      "subsequent chaos had to be handled by a wrathful head of the department\n",
      "in person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Man's power of endurance is limited. At the end of the second week the\n",
      "overwrought head appealed passionately for relief, and Owen was removed\n",
      "to the Postage Department, where, when he had leisure from answering\n",
      "Audrey's telephone calls, he entered the addresses of letters in a\n",
      "large book and took them to the post. He was supposed also to stamp\n",
      "them, but a man in love cannot think of everything, and he was apt at\n",
      "times to overlook this formality.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, receiving from one of the bank messengers the usual\n",
      "intimation that a lady wished to speak to him on the telephone, he went\n",
      "to the box and took up the receiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that you, Owen? Owen, I went to _White Roses_ last night. Have\n",
      "you been yet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you must go tonight. Owen, I'm _certain_ you wrote it. It's\n",
      "perfectly lovely. I cried my eyes out. If you don't go tonight, I'll\n",
      "never speak to you again, even on the telephone. Promise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Must I?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, you must. Why, suppose it _is_ yours! It may mean a fortune.\n",
      "The stalls were simply packed. I'm going to ring up the theatre now and\n",
      "engage a seat for you, and pay for it myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No--I say--' protested Owen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, I shall. I can't trust you to go if I don't. And I'll ring up\n",
      "early tomorrow to hear all about it. Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen left the box somewhat depressed. Life was quite gloomy enough as\n",
      "it was, without going out of one's way to cry one's eyes out over\n",
      "sentimental plays.\n",
      "\n",
      "His depression was increased by the receipt, on his return to his\n",
      "department, of a message from the manager, stating that he would like\n",
      "to see Mr Bentley in his private room for a moment. Owen never enjoyed\n",
      "these little chats with Authority. Out of office hours, in the circle\n",
      "of his friends, he had no doubt the manager was a delightful and\n",
      "entertaining companion; but in his private room his conversation was\n",
      "less enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager was seated at his table, thoughtfully regarding the\n",
      "ceiling. His resemblance to a stuffed trout, always striking, was\n",
      "subtly accentuated, and Owen, an expert in these matters, felt that his\n",
      "fears had been well founded--there was trouble in the air. Somebody had\n",
      "been complaining of him, and he was now about, as the phrase went, to\n",
      "be 'run-in'.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large man, seated with his back to the door, turned as he entered,\n",
      "and Owen recognized the well-remembered features of Mr Prosser, the\n",
      "literary loaf-slinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen regarded him without resentment. Since returning to London he had\n",
      "taken the trouble of looking up his name in _Who's Who_ and had\n",
      "found that he was not so undistinguished as he had supposed. He was, it\n",
      "appeared, a Regius Professor and the author of some half-dozen works on\n",
      "sociology--a record, Owen felt, that almost justified loaf-slinging and\n",
      "ear-hole clipping in moments of irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager started to speak, but the man of letters anticipated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is this the fool?' he roared. 'Young man, I have no wish to be hard on\n",
      "a congenital idiot who is not responsible for his actions, but I must\n",
      "insist on an explanation. I understand that you are in charge of the\n",
      "correspondence in this office. Well, during the last week you have\n",
      "three times sent unstamped letters to my fiancee, Miss Vera Delane,\n",
      "Woodlands, Southbourne, Hants. What's the matter with you? Do you think\n",
      "she likes paying twopence a time, or what is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen's mind leaped back at the words. They recalled something to him.\n",
      "Then he remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conscious of a not unpleasant thrill. He had not known that he\n",
      "was superstitious, but for some reason he had not been able to get\n",
      "those absurd words of Mr Dorman's mother out of his mind. And here was\n",
      "another prediction of hers, equally improbable, fulfilled to the\n",
      "letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Great Scott!' he cried. 'Are you going to be married?'\n",

      "\n",
      "'No, no.'\n",
      "\n",

      "'I'm very sorry. I have to go to the theatre tonight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then come and have a bit of supper afterwards. Excellent. Meet me at\n",
      "the Savoy at eleven-fifteen. I'm glad I didn't hit you with that loaf.\n",

      "The manager, who had been listening with some restlessness to the\n",

      "things, and he objected to having his private room made the scene of\n",
      "what appeared to be a reunion of old college chums. He hinted as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ha! Prrumph!' he observed, disapprovingly. 'Er--Mr Bentley, that is\n",

      "securely wedged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cheaper parts of the house were sparsely occupied, but the stalls\n",
      "were full. Owen, disapproving of the whole business, refused to buy a\n",
      "programme, and settled himself in his seat prepared for the worst. He\n",
      "had a vivid recollection of _White Roses_, the novel, and he did\n",
      "not anticipate any keen enjoyment from it in its dramatized form. He\n",
      "had long ceased to be a member of that large public for which Miss\n",
      "Edith Butler catered. The sentimental adventures of governesses in\n",

      "what was going on on the stage. At the beginning of the second act he\n",
      "found himself anticipating events. But it was not till the third act\n",
      "that the truth sank in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third was the only act in which, in his dramatization, he had taken\n",
      "any real liberties with the text of the novel. But in this act he had\n",
      "introduced a character who did not appear in the novel--a creature of\n",
      "his own imagination. And now, with bulging eyes, he observed this\n",
      "creature emerge from the wings, and heard him utter lines which he now\n",
      "clearly remembered having written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey had been right! Serpent Edith Butler had stolen his play.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mind, during the remainder of the play, was active. By the time the\n",
      "final curtain fell and he passed out into the open air he had perceived\n",
      "some of the difficulties of the case. To prove oneself the author of an\n",
      "original play is hard, but not impossible. Friends to whom one had\n",
      "sketched the plot may come forward as witnesses. One may have preserved\n",
      "rough notes. But a dramatization of a novel is another matter. All\n",
      "dramatizations of any given novel must necessarily be very much alike.\n",

      "He started to walk along Piccadilly, and had reached Hyde Park Corner\n",

      "\n",
      "Owen was still thinking deeply as he began his supper. Surely there was\n",
      "some way by which he could prove his claims. What had he done with the\n",
      "original manuscript? He remembered now. He had burnt it. It had seemed\n",
      "mere useless litter then. Probably, he felt bitterly, the woman Butler\n",
      "had counted on this.\n",

      "Mr Prosser concluded an animated conversation with a waiter on the\n",
      "subject of the wines of France, leaned forward, and, having helped\n",
      "himself briskly to anchovies, began to talk. He talked loudly and\n",
      "rapidly. Owen, his thoughts far away, hardly listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the waiter returned with the selected brand. He filled Owen's\n",
      "glass, and Owen drank, and felt better. Finding his glass magically\n",
      "full once more, he emptied it again. And then suddenly he found himself\n",
      "looking across the table at his Host, and feeling a sense of absolute\n",
      "conviction that this was the one man of all others whom he would have\n",
      "selected as a confidant. How kindly, though somewhat misty, his face\n",
      "was! How soothing, if a little indistinct, his voice!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Prosser,' he said, 'you are a man of the world, and I should like your\n",

      "a play, and what do I find?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and eyed his host impressively.\n",
      "\n",

      "everywhere. One of these Viennese things, I suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen was annoyed. He began to doubt whether, after all, Mr Prosser's\n",
      "virtues as a confidant were not more apparent than real.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I find, by Jove,' he continued, 'that I wrote the thing myself.'\n",

      "\n",
      "'What do you mean?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen plunged on with his story. He started from its dim beginning, from\n",
      "the days when he had bought the novel on his journey from Bath to\n",
      "Cheltenham. He described his methods of work, his registering of the\n",
      "package, his suspense, his growing resignation. He sketched the\n",
      "progress of his life. He spoke of Audrey and gave a crisp\n",
      "character-sketch of Mr Sheppherd. He took his hearer right up to\n",
      "the moment when the truth had come home to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of his narrative the lights went out, and he finished\n",
      "his story in the hotel courtyard. In the cool air he felt revived. The\n",
      "outlines of Mr Prosser became sharp and distinct again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sociologist listened admirably. He appeared absorbed, and did not\n",
      "interrupt once.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What makes you so certain that this was your version?' he asked, as\n",
      "they passed into the Strand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen told him of the creature of his imagination in Act III.\n",

      "unkindly. 'Young man, I begin to believe that there may be something in\n",
      "this. You haven't got a ghost of a proof that would hold water in a\n",
      "court of law, of course; but still, I'm inclined to believe you. For\n",

      "\n",
      "'In fact, if you can answer me one question I shall be satisfied.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Owen that Mr Prosser was tending to get a little above\n",
      "himself. As an intelligent listener he had been of service, but that\n",
      "appeared to be no reason why he should constitute himself a sort of\n",
      "judge and master of the ceremonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's very good of you,' he said; 'but will Edith Butler be\n",
      "satisfied? That's more to the point.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'You need not babble it from the house-tops. You are the only person\n",
      "besides my agent who knows it, and I wouldn't have told you if I could\n",
      "have helped it. It isn't a thing I want known. Great Scott, man, don't\n",

      "listen to me. That manuscript reached me when I was in the country.\n",
      "There was no name on it. That in itself points strongly to the fact\n",
      "that you were its author. It was precisely the chuckle-headed sort of\n",
      "thing you would have done, to put no name on the thing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I enclosed a letter, anyhow.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There was a letter enclosed. I opened the parcel out of doors. There\n",
      "was a fresh breeze blowing at the time. It caught the letter, and that\n",
      "was the last I saw of it. I had read as far as \"Dear Madam\". But one\n",
      "thing I do remember about it, and that was that it was sent from some\n",
      "hotel in Cheltenham, and I could remember it if I heard it. Now, then?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can tell it you. It was Wilbraham's. I was stopping there.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Then do you mean to say that it's all right--that you believe--'\n",

      "\n",
      "'It was. Packed with paper. All the merry dead-heads in London were\n",
      "there. It has been the worst failure this season. And, by George,' he\n",
      "cried, with sudden vehemence, 'serve 'em right. If I told them once it\n",

      "his way.\n",

      "another, it was Young Men Who Ought To Be Out Earning Their Livings\n",

      "'Good morning, sir,' said Violet.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my list of contributory causes I find that I have omitted one\n",
      "item--viz., that there did not appear to be anybody else about.\n",
      "\n",
      "James looked meditatively at Violet. Violet looked smilingly at James.\n",
      "The morning was just as ripping as it had been a moment before. James\n",
      "was still twenty-two. And the editor's letter had not ceased to crackle\n",
      "in his breast-pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently James stooped, and--in a purely brotherly way--kissed\n",
      "Violet.\n",
      "\n",

      "assistant-master at Harrow House to wander about bestowing brotherly\n",
      "kisses on housemaids. On the other hand, there was no great harm done.\n",

      "it. The difficulty which had always handicapped him hitherto--namely,\n",
      "the poverty of the vocabularies of those in the servants' quarters--was\n",
      "now removed. He appointed James tutor-in-chief of the English language\n",

      "went into the derivations of the words. He touched on certain rather\n",
      "tricky sub-meanings of the same. Adolf went away with any doubts he\n",

      "definitely scattered. He felt that he had got hold of the right man.\n",
      "\n",

      "Something should have warned Adolf that the moment was not well chosen.\n",
      "To begin with, James had a headache, the result of a hard day with the\n",
      "boys. Then that morning's English lesson had caused him to forget\n",
      "entirely an idea which had promised to be the nucleus of an excellent\n",
      "plot. And, lastly, passing through the hall but an instant before, he\n",
      "had met Violet, carrying the coffee and the evening post to the study,\n",
      "and she had given him two long envelopes addressed in his own\n",

      "It was at this point that James kicked him.\n",

      "'Vot iss?' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these long envelopes in his hand James cared for nothing. He\n",
      "kicked Adolf again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Zo!' said the student, having bounded away. He added a few words in\n",
      "his native tongue, and proceeded. 'Vait! Lizzun! I zay to you, vait!\n",

      "tissues with coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in the study, leaning against the mantelpiece in moody\n",
      "reflection, Mr Blatherwick was musing sadly on the hardships of the\n",
      "schoolmaster's life. The proprietor of Harrow House was a long, grave\n",
      "man, one of the last to hold out against the anti-whisker crusade. He\n",
      "had expressionless hazel eyes, and a general air of being present in\n",
      "body but absent in spirit. Mothers who visited the school to introduce\n",
      "their sons put his vagueness down to activity of mind. 'That busy\n",
      "brain,' they thought, 'is never at rest. Even while he is talking to\n",
      "us some abstruse point in the classics is occupying his mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "What was occupying his mind at the present moment was the thoroughly\n",
      "unsatisfactory conduct of his wife's brother, Bertie Baxter. The more\n",
      "tensely he brooded over the salient points in the life-history of his\n",
      "wife's brother, Bertie Baxter, the deeper did the iron become embedded\n",
      "in his soul. Bertie was one of Nature's touchers. This is the age of\n",
      "the specialist, Bertie's speciality was borrowing money. He was a man\n",
      "of almost eerie versatility in this direction. Time could not wither\n",
      "nor custom stale his infinite variety. He could borrow with a breezy\n",
      "bluffness which made the thing practically a hold-up. And anon, when\n",
      "his victim had steeled himself against this method, he could extract\n",
      "another five-pound note from his little hoard with the delicacy of one\n",
      "playing spillikins. Mr Blatherwick had been a gold-mine to him for\n",
      "years. As a rule, the proprietor of Harrow House unbelted without\n",
      "complaint, for Bertie, as every good borrower should, had that knack of\n",
      "making his victim feel during the actual moment of paying over, as if\n",
      "he had just made a rather good investment. But released from the spell\n",
      "of his brother-in-law's personal magnetism, Mr Blatherwick was apt to\n",
      "brood. He was brooding now. Why, he was asking himself morosely, should\n",
      "he be harassed by this Bertie? It was not as if Bertie was penniless.\n",
      "He had a little income of his own. No, it was pure lack of\n",
      "consideration. Who was Bertie that he--\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point in his meditations Violet entered with the after-dinner\n",
      "coffee and the evening post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blatherwick took the letters. There were two of them, and one he\n",
      "saw, with a rush of indignation, was in the handwriting of his\n",
      "brother-in-law. Mr Blatherwick's blood simmered. So the fellow thought\n",
      "he could borrow by post, did he? Not even trouble to pay a visit, eh?\n",
      "He tore the letter open, and the first thing he saw was a cheque for\n",
      "five pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blatherwick was astounded. That a letter from his brother-in-law\n",
      "should not contain a request for money was surprising; that it should\n",
      "contain a cheque, even for five pounds, was miraculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the second letter. It was short, but full of the finest,\n",
      "noblest sentiments; to wit, that the writer, Charles J. Pickersgill,\n",
      "having heard the school so highly spoken of by his friend, Mr Herbert\n",
      "Baxter, would be glad if Mr Blatherwick could take in his three sons,\n",
      "aged seven, nine, and eleven respectively, at the earliest convenient\n",
      "date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blatherwick's first feeling was one of remorse that even in thought\n",
      "he should have been harsh to the golden-hearted Bertie. His next was\n",
      "one of elation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Violet, meanwhile, stood patiently before him with the coffee. Mr\n",
      "Blatherwick helped himself. His eye fell on Violet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Violet was a friendly, warm-hearted little thing. She saw that Mr\n",
      "Blatherwick had had good news; and, as the bearer of the letters which\n",
      "had contained it, she felt almost responsible. She smiled kindly up at\n",
      "Mr Blatherwick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blatherwick's dreamy hazel eye rested pensively upon her. The major\n",
      "portion of his mind was far away in the future, dealing with visions of\n",
      "a school grown to colossal proportions, and patronized by millionaires.\n",
      "The section of it which still worked in the present was just large\n",
      "enough to enable him to understand that he felt kindly, and even almost\n",
      "grateful, to Violet. Unfortunately it was too small to make him see how\n",
      "wrong it was to kiss her in a vague, fatherly way across the coffee\n",

      "\n",
      "James paused. Mr Blatherwick coughed. Violet, absolutely unmoved,\n",

      "large white statue, labelled 'Our City', the figure of a woman in\n",
      "Grecian robes holding aloft a shield. Critical citizens objected to it\n",
      "for various reasons, but its real fault was that its symbolism was\n",
      "faulty. The sculptor should have represented New York as a conjuror in\n",
      "evening dress, smiling blandly as he changed a rabbit into a bowl of\n",
      "goldfish. For that, above all else, is New York's speciality. It\n",

      "Between 1 May, when she stepped off the train, and 16 May, when she\n",
      "received Eddy Moore's letter containing the information that he had\n",
      "found her a post as stenographer in the office of Joe Rendal, it had\n",
      "changed Mary Hill quite remarkably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary was from Dunsterville, which is in Canada. Emigrations from\n",
      "Dunsterville were rare. It is a somnolent town; and, as a rule, young\n",
      "men born there follow in their father's footsteps, working on the\n",
      "paternal farm or helping in the paternal store. Occasionally a daring\n",
      "spirit will break away, but seldom farther than Montreal. Two only of\n",
      "the younger generation, Joe Rendal and Eddy Moore, had set out to make\n",
      "their fortunes in New York; and both, despite the gloomy prophecies of\n",
      "the village sages, had prospered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, third and last emigrant, did not aspire to such heights. All she\n",
      "demanded from New York for the present was that it should pay her a\n",
      "living wage, and to that end, having studied by stealth typewriting and\n",
      "shorthand, she had taken the plunge, thrilling with excitement and the\n",
      "romance of things; and New York had looked at her, raised its eyebrows,\n",
      "and looked away again. If every city has a voice, New York's at that\n",
      "moment had said 'Huh!' This had damped Mary. She saw that there were\n",
      "going to be obstacles. For one thing, she had depended so greatly on\n",
      "Eddy Moore, and he had failed her. Three years before, at a church\n",
      "festival, he had stated specifically that he would die for her. Perhaps\n",
      "he was still willing to do that--she had not inquired--but, at any\n",
      "rate, he did not see his way to employing her as a secretary. He had\n",
      "been very nice about it. He had smiled kindly, taken her address, and\n",
      "said he would do what he could, and had then hurried off to meet a man\n",
      "at lunch. But he had not given her a position. And as the days went by\n",
      "and she found no employment, and her little stock of money dwindled,\n",
      "and no word came from Eddy, New York got to work and changed her\n",
      "outlook on things wonderfully. What had seemed romantic became merely\n",
      "frightening. What had been exciting gave her a feeling of dazed\n",
      "helplessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not until Eddy's letter came that she realized the\n",
      "completeness of the change. On 1 May she would have thanked Eddy\n",
      "politely for his trouble, adding, however, that she would really prefer\n",
      "not to meet poor Joe again. On 16 May she welcomed him as something\n",
      "Heaven-sent. The fact that she was to be employed outweighed a\n",
      "thousand-fold the fact that her employer was to be Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not that she disliked Joe. She was sorry for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered Joe, a silent, shambling youth, all hands, feet, and\n",
      "shyness, who had spent most of his spare time twisting his fingers and\n",
      "staring adoringly at her from afar. The opinion of those in the social\n",
      "whirl of Dunsterville had been that it was his hopeless passion for her\n",
      "that had made him fly to New York. It would be embarrassing meeting him\n",
      "again. It would require tact to discourage his silent worshipping\n",
      "without wounding him more deeply. She hated hurting people.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, even at the cost of that, she must accept the post. To refuse\n",
      "meant ignominious retreat to Dunsterville, and from that her pride\n",

      "situated about half-way up a building that, to Mary, reared amidst the\n",

      "to the sky. A proud-looking office-boy, apparently baffled and\n",
      "mortified by the information that she had an appointment, took her\n",

      "emotions, to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time since her arrival in New York she felt almost easy\n",
      "in her mind. New York, with its shoving, jostling, hurrying crowds; a\n",
      "giant fowl-run, full of human fowls scurrying to and fro; clucking,\n",
      "ever on the look-out for some desired morsel, and ever ready to swoop\n",
      "down and snatch it from its temporary possessor, had numbed her. But\n",
      "now she felt a slackening of the strain. New York might be too much for\n",
      "her, but she could cope with Joe.\n",
      "\n",

      "into an inner room, where a big man was seated at a desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Joe. There was no doubt about that. But it was not the Joe she\n",
      "remembered, he of the twisted ringers and silent stare. In his case,\n",
      "New York had conjured effectively. He was better-looking, better-dressed,\n",
      "improved in every respect. In the old days one had noticed the hands\n",
      "and feet and deduced the presence of Joe somewhere in the background.\n",
      "Now they were merely adjuncts. It was with a rush of indignation that\n",
      "Mary found herself bucolic and awkward. Awkward with Joe! It was an\n",
      "outrage.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manner heightened the feeling. If he had given the least sign of\n",
      "embarrassment she might have softened towards him. He showed no\n",
      "embarrassment whatever. He was very much at his ease. He was cheerful.\n",
      "He was even flippant.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Welcome to our beautiful little city,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary was filled with a helpless anger. What right had he to ignore the\n",
      "past in this way, to behave as if her presence had never reduced him to\n",
      "pulp?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Won't you sit down?' he went on. 'It's splendid, seeing you again,\n",
      "Mary. You're looking very well. How long have you been in New York?\n",
      "Eddy tells me you want to be taken on as a secretary. As it happens,\n",
      "there is a vacancy for just that in this office. A big, wide vacancy,\n",
      "left by a lady who departed yesterday in a shower of burning words and\n",
      "hairpins. She said she would never return, and between ourselves, that\n",
      "was the right guess. Would you mind letting me see what you can do?\n",
      "Will you take this letter down?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly there was something compelling about this new Joe. Mary took\n",
      "the pencil and pad which he offered--and she took them meekly. Until\n",
      "this moment she had always been astonished by the reports which\n",
      "filtered through to Dunsterville of his success in the big city. Of\n",
      "course, nobody had ever doubted his perseverance; but it takes\n",
      "something more than perseverance to fight New York fairly and squarely,\n",
      "and win. And Joe had that something. He had force. He was sure of\n",
      "himself.\n",

      "For a moment Mary was on the point of refusing. A mad desire gripped\n",
      "her to assert herself, to make plain her resentment at this revolt of\n",

      "standards--presentable. Tall, slim, with dark eyes that made you catch\n",
      "your breath when they looked into yours, and a ready flow of speech,\n",
      "he had been Dunsterville's prize exhibit. And here he was with all his\n",
      "excellence heightened and accentuated by the polish of the city. He\n",

      "awkwardness in the struggle for success in New York. His words, his\n",

      "He touched her hand again. This time, somehow, the action grated on\n",
      "her. Before, it had seemed impulsive, a mere spontaneous evidence\n",
      "of friendship. Now there was a suggestion of artificiality,--of\n",
      "calculation. She drew back a little in her chair. Deep down in her\n",
      "some watchful instinct had sounded an alarm. She was on guard.\n",
      "\n",

      "early information too. Do you remember my telling you that your\n",
      "predecessor at the office left a little abruptly? There was a reason. I\n",
      "engaged her as a confidential secretary, and she overdid it. She\n",
      "confided in Eddy. From the look on your face as I came in I gathered\n",

      "had fallen out with Harold Flower in the offices of the Planet\n",
      "Insurance Company. For a day after his arrival he had clung to the garb\n",
      "of middle-class England. On the second he had discovered that this was\n",
      "unpleasantly warm and, worse, conspicuous. At the Casino Municipale\n",
      "that evening he had observed a man wearing an arrangement in bright\n",
      "yellow velvet without attracting attention. The sight had impressed\n",
      "him. Next morning he had emerged from his hotel in a flannel suit so\n",
      "light that it had been unanimously condemned as impossible by his Uncle\n",

      "Internally his alteration had been even more considerable. Roville was\n",
      "not Monte Carlo (in which gay spot he had remained only long enough to\n",
      "send a picture post-card to Harold Flower before retiring down the\n",
      "coast to find something cheaper), but it had been a revelation to him.\n",
      "For the first time in his life he was seeing colour, and it intoxicated\n",
      "him. The silky blueness of the sea was startling. The pure white of the\n",
      "great hotels along the promenade and the Casino Municipale fascinated\n",
      "him. He was dazzled. At the Casino the pillars were crimson and cream,\n",
      "the tables sky-blue and pink. Seated on a green-and-white striped chair\n",
      "he watched a _revue_, of which from start to finish he understood\n",

      "in a mauve flannel suit looked on at the brawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during that evening that there flitted across his mind the first\n",
      "suspicion he had ever had that his Uncle Robert's mental outlook was a\n",

      "\n",
      "And now, as he paced the promenade, watching the stir and bustle of the\n",

      "of time was injudicious; and George, warned by a red-hot shooting\n",
      "sensation that the moment had arrived for rest, sank down gracefully on\n",

      "something oblong with sharp corners.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a book--a fat new novel. George drew it out and inspected it.\n",

      "\n",
      "'I missed it, and I couldn't think where I could have left it. Then I\n",
      "remembered that I had been sitting here. Thank you so much.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled again, turned, and walked away, leaving George to reckon up\n",
      "all the social solecisms he had contrived to commit in the space of a\n",
      "single moment. He had remained seated, he reminded himself, throughout\n",
      "the interview; one. He had not raised his hat, that fascinating Homburg\n",
      "simply made to be raised with a debonair swish under such conditions;\n",
      "two. Call it three, because he ought to have raised it twice. He had\n",
      "gaped like a fool; four. And, five, he had not uttered a single word of\n",
      "acknowledgement in reply to her thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five vast bloomers in under a minute! What could she have thought of\n",
      "him? The sun ceased to shine. What sort of an utter outsider could she\n",
      "have considered him? An east wind sprang up. What kind of a Cockney\n",
      "bounder and cad could she have taken him for? The sea turned to an oily\n",
      "grey; and George, rising, strode back in the direction of his hotel in\n",
      "a mood that made him forget that he had brown boots on at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mind was active. Several times since he had come to Roville he had\n",
      "been conscious of a sensation which he could not understand, a vague,\n",
      "yearning sensation, a feeling that, splendid as everything was in this\n",
      "paradise of colour, there was nevertheless something lacking. Now he\n",
      "understood. You had to be in love to get the full flavour of these\n",
      "vivid whites and blues. He was getting it now. His mood of dejection\n",
      "had passed swiftly, to be succeeded by an exhilaration such as he had\n",
      "only felt once in his life before, about half-way through a dinner\n",
      "given to the Planet staff on a princely scale by a retiring general\n",
      "manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was exalted. Nothing seemed impossible to him. He would meet the\n",
      "girl again on the promenade, he told himself, dashingly renew the\n",
      "acquaintance, show her that he was not the gaping idiot he had\n",
      "appeared. His imagination donned its seven-league boots. He saw himself\n",
      "proposing--eloquently--accepted, married, living happily ever after.\n",
      "\n",
      "It occurred to him that an excellent first move would be to find out\n",
      "where she was staying. He bought a paper and turned to the list of\n",
      "visitors. Miss Waveney. Where was it. He ran his eye down the column.\n",

      "may obtain oblivion by means of the ingenious game of _boule_.\n",

      "passion. From the instant when he read the fatal words in the paper he\n",
      "had recognized its hopelessness. All other obstacles he had been\n",
      "prepared to overcome, but a title--no. He had no illusions as to his\n",

      "recklessly on evens. It won.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was enough. Thrusting his hat on the back of his head and wedging\n",
      "himself firmly against the table, he settled down to make a night of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing like _boule_ for absorbing the mind. It was some\n",
      "time before George became aware that a hand was prodding him in the\n",
      "ribs. He turned, irritated. Immediately behind him, filling the\n",
      "landscape, were two stout Frenchmen. But, even as he searched his brain\n",
      "for words that would convey to them in their native tongue his\n",
      "disapproval of this jostling, he perceived that they, though stout and\n",
      "in a general way offensive, were in this particular respect guiltless.\n",
      "The prodding hand belonged to somebody invisible behind them. It was\n",
      "small and gloved, a woman's hand. It held a five-franc piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in a gap, caused by a movement in the crowd, he saw the face of\n",
      "Lady Julia Waveney.\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'On eight, please, would you mind?' he heard her say, and then the\n",
      "crowd shifted again and she disappeared, leaving him holding the coin,\n",
      "his mind in a whirl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game of _boule_ demands undivided attention from its devotees.\n",
      "To play with a mind full of other matters is a mistake. This mistake\n",
      "George made. Hardly conscious of what he was doing, he flung the coin\n",
      "on the board. She had asked him to place it on eight, and he thought\n",
      "that he had placed it on eight. That, in reality, blinded by emotion,\n",
      "he had placed it on three was a fact which came home to him neither\n",
      "then nor later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, when the ball ceased to roll and a sepulchral voice\n",
      "croaked the news that eight was the winning number, he fixed on the\n",
      "croupier a gaze that began by being joyful and expectant and ended, the\n",
      "croupier remaining entirely unresponsive, by being wrathful.\n",
      "\n",
      "He leaned towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Monsieur,' he said. _'Moi! J'ai jete cinq francs sur huit!'_\n",
      "\n",
      "The croupier was a man with a pointed moustache and an air of having\n",
      "seen all the sorrow and wickedness that there had ever been in the\n",
      "world. He twisted the former and permitted a faint smile to deepen the\n",
      "melancholy of the latter, but he did not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "George moved to his side. The two stout Frenchmen had strolled off,\n",
      "leaving elbow-room behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tapped the croupier on the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I say,' he said. 'What's the game? _J'ai jete cinq francs sur\n",
      "huit,_ I tell you, _moi!_'\n",
      "\n",
      "A forgotten idiom from the days of boyhood and French exercises came to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'_Moi qui parle_,' he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "'_Messieurs, faites vos jeux_,' crooned the croupier, in a\n",
      "detached manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the normal George, as to most Englishmen of his age, the one\n",
      "cardinal rule in life was at all costs to avoid rendering himself\n",
      "conspicuous in public. Than George normal, no violet that ever hid\n",
      "itself in a mossy bank could have had a greater distaste for scenes.\n",
      "But tonight he was not normal. Roville and its colour had wrought a\n",
      "sort of fever in his brain. _Boule_ had increased it. And love had\n",
      "caused it to rage. If this had been entirely his own affair it is\n",
      "probable that the croupier's frigid calm would have quelled him and he\n",
      "would have retired, fermenting but baffled. But it was not his own\n",
      "affair. He was fighting the cause of the only girl in the world. She\n",
      "had trusted him. Could he fail her? No, he was dashed if he could. He\n",
      "would show her what he was made of. His heart swelled within him. A\n",
      "thrill permeated his entire being, starting at his head and running out\n",
      "at his heels. He felt tremendous--a sort of blend of Oliver Cromwell, a\n",
      "Berserk warrior, and Sir Galahad.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Monsieur,' he said again. 'Hi! What about it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "This time the croupier did speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "'_C'est fini_,' he said; and print cannot convey the pensive scorn\n",
      "of his voice. It stung George, in his exalted mood, like a blow.\n",
      "Finished, was it? All right, now he would show them. They had asked for\n",
      "it, and now they should get it. How much did it come to? Five francs\n",
      "the stake had been, and you got seven times your stake. And you got\n",
      "your stake back. He was nearly forgetting that. Forty francs in all,\n",
      "then. Two of those gold what-d'you-call'ems, in fact. Very well, then.\n",
      "\n",
      "He leaned forward quickly across the croupier, snatched the lid off the\n",
      "gold tray, and removed two louis.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a remarkable fact in life that the scenes which we have rehearsed\n",
      "in our minds never happen as we have pictured them happening. In the\n",
      "present case, for instance, it had been George's intention to handle\n",
      "the subsequent stages of this little dispute with an easy dignity. He\n",
      "had proposed, the money obtained, to hand it over to its rightful\n",
      "owner, raise his hat, and retire with an air, a gallant champion of the\n",
      "oppressed. It was probably about one-sixteenth of a second after his\n",
      "hand had closed on the coins that he realized in the most vivid manner\n",
      "that these were not the lines on which the incident was to develop,\n",
      "and, with all his heart, he congratulated himself on having discarded\n",
      "those brown boots in favour of a worn but roomy pair of gent's Oxfords.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment,\n",
      "while the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted\n",
      "themselves to the marvel, and then the world became full of starting\n",
      "eyes, yelling throats, and clutching hands. From all over the casino\n",
      "fresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of\n",
      "things. Promenaders ceased to promenade, waiters to wait. Elderly\n",
      "gentlemen sprang on to tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in that momentary pause George had got off the mark. The table at\n",
      "which he had been standing was the one nearest to the door, and he had\n",
      "been on the door side of it. As the first eyes began to start, the\n",
      "first throats to yell, and the first hands to clutch, he was passing\n",
      "the counter of the money-changer. He charged the swing-door at full\n",
      "speed, and, true to its mission, it swung. He had a vague glimpse from\n",
      "the corner of his eye of the hat-and-cloak counter, and then he was in\n",
      "the square with the cold night breeze blowing on his forehead and the\n",
      "stars winking down from the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "A paper-seller on the pavement, ever the man of business, stepped\n",
      "forward and offered him the Paris edition of the _Daily Mail_,\n",
      "and, being in the direct line of transit, shot swiftly into the road\n",
      "and fell into a heap, while George, shaken but going well, turned off\n",
      "to the left, where there seemed to be rather more darkness than\n",
      "anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the casino disgorged the pursuers.\n",
      "\n",
      "To George, looking hastily over his shoulder, there seemed a thousand\n",
      "of them. The square rang with their cries. He could not understand\n",
      "them, but gathered that they were uncomplimentary. At any rate, they\n",
      "stimulated a little man in evening dress strolling along the pavement\n",
      "towards him, to become suddenly animated and to leap from side to side\n",
      "with outstretched arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Panic makes Harlequin three-quarters of us all. For one who had never\n",
      "played Rugby football George handled the situation well. He drew the\n",
      "defence with a feint to the left, then, swerving to the right, shot\n",
      "past into the friendly darkness. From behind came the ringing of feet\n",
      "and an evergrowing din.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is one of the few compensations a fugitive pursued by a crowd enjoys\n",
      "that, while he has space for his manoeuvres, those who pursue are\n",
      "hampered by their numbers. In the little regiment that pounded at his\n",
      "heels it is probable that there were many faster runners than George.\n",
      "On the other hand, there were many slower, and in the early stages of\n",
      "the chase these impeded their swifter brethren. At the end of the first\n",
      "half-minute, therefore, George, not sparing himself, had drawn well\n",
      "ahead, and for the first time found leisure for connected thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "His brain became preternaturally alert, so that when, rounding a\n",
      "corner, he perceived entering the main road from a side-street in front\n",
      "of him a small knot of pedestrians, he did not waver, but was seized\n",
      "with a keen spasm of presence of mind. Without pausing in his stride,\n",
      "he pointed excitedly before him, and at the same moment shouted the\n",
      "words, '_La! La! Vite! Vite!_'\n",
      "\n",
      "His stock of French was small, but it ran to that, and for his purpose\n",
      "it was ample. The French temperament is not stolid. When the French\n",
      "temperament sees a man running rapidly and pointing into the middle\n",
      "distance and hears him shouting, '_La! La! Vite! Vite!_' it does\n",
      "not stop to make formal inquiries. It sprints like a mustang. It did so\n",
      "now, with the happy result that a moment later George was racing down\n",
      "the road, the centre and recognized leader of an enthusiastic band of\n",
      "six, which, in the next twenty yards, swelled to eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes later, in a wine-shop near the harbour, he was sipping the\n",
      "first glass of a bottle of cheap but comforting _vin ordinaire_\n",
      "while he explained to the interested proprietor, by means of a mixture\n",
      "of English, broken French, and gestures that he had been helping to\n",
      "chase a thief, but had been forced by fatigue to retire prematurely for\n",
      "refreshment. The proprietor gathered, however, that he had every\n",
      "confidence in the zeal of his still active colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is convincing evidence of the extent to which love had triumphed\n",
      "over prudence in George's soul that the advisability of lying hid in\n",
      "his hotel on the following day did not even cross his mind. Immediately\n",
      "after breakfast, or what passed for it at Roville, he set out for the\n",
      "Hotel Cercle de la Mediterranee to hand over the two louis to their\n",
      "owner.\n",

      "\n",
      "'He arrived two days ago on the _Baltic_, sir. He left a message\n",

      "royal commands. Rollo was glad that the visit had happened now. In\n",
      "another two weeks it might have been disastrous to the schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The club to which the Braces King belonged was a richly but gloomily\n",
      "furnished building in Pall Mall, a place of soft carpets, shaded\n",
      "lights, and whispers. Grave, elderly men moved noiselessly to and fro,\n",
      "or sat in meditative silence in deep arm-chairs. Sometimes the visitor\n",
      "felt that he was in a cathedral, sometimes in a Turkish bath; while now\n",
      "and then there was a suggestion of the waiting-room of a more than\n",
      "usually prosperous dentist. It was magnificent, but not exhilarating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rollo was shown into the smoking-room, where his uncle received him.\n",
      "There was a good deal of Mr Andrew Galloway. Grief, gnawing at his\n",
      "heart, had not sagged his ample waistcoat, which preceded him as he\n",
      "moved in much the same manner as Birnam Woods preceded the army of\n",
      "Macduff. A well-nourished hand crept round the corner of the edifice\n",
      "and enveloped Rollo's in a powerful grip.\n",

      "It would be absurd to say that Rollo looked at his uncle keenly. He was\n",
      "not capable of looking keenly at anyone. But certainly a puzzled\n",
      "expression came into his face. Whether it was the heartiness of the\n",
      "other's hand-shake or the unusual cheeriness of his voice, he could not\n",
      "say; but something gave him the impression that a curious change had\n",
      "come over the Braces King. When they had met before during the last few\n",
      "years Mr Galloway had been practically sixteen stone five of blood and\n",
      "iron--one of those stern, soured men. His attitude had been that of one\n",

      "this sort of thing at any time, I'll go to Paris and hunt up the\n",

      "\n",
      "In the cab Rollo risked the headache. At whatever cost this thing must\n",
      "be pondered over. His uncle prattled gaily throughout the journey. Once\n",
      "he whooped--some weird, forgotten college yell, dragged from the misty\n",
      "depths of the past. It was passing strange. And in this unusual manner\n",
      "the two rolled into the Strand, and drew up at Romano's door.\n",

      "Mr Galloway was a good trencherman. At a very early date he had\n",
      "realized that a man who wishes to make satisfactory braces must keep\n",
      "his strength up. He wanted a good deal here below, and he wanted it\n",
      "warm and well cooked. It was, therefore, not immediately that his\n",
      "dinner with Rollo became a feast of reason and a flow of soul. Indeed,\n",

      "any remark that was not purely gastronomic.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Rollo, in the act of sipping a liqueur brandy, lowered his glass in\n",
      "surprise. His head was singing slightly as the result of some rather\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr Galloway continued, his voice rising as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Strictly speaking, this was incorrect, unless one counted Methuselah;\n",

      "\n",

      "supper-party last night at which an actress was present. And a more\n",
      "charming, sensible girl I never wish to meet. Not one of your silly,\n",

      "millionaire, always a Pittsburgh millionaire. For eleven years his\n",
      "uncle had fought against his natural propensities, with apparent\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time ago, when spending a delightful week-end at the ancestral\n",
      "castle of my dear old friend, the Duke of Weatherstonhope (pronounced\n",
      "Wop), I came across an old black-letter MS. It is on this that the\n",
      "story which follows is based.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found it necessary to touch the thing up a little here and\n",
      "there, for writers in those days were weak in construction. Their idea\n",
      "of telling a story was to take a long breath and start droning away\n",
      "without any stops or dialogue till the thing was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also condensed the title. In the original it ran, '\"How it came\n",
      "about that ye good Knight Sir Agravaine ye Dolorous of ye Table Round\n",
      "did fare forth to succour a damsel in distress and after divers\n",
      "journeyings and perils by flood and by field did win her for his bride\n",
      "and right happily did they twain live ever afterwards,\" by Ambrose ye\n",
      "monk.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pretty snappy title for those days, but we have such a high\n",
      "standard in titles nowadays that I have felt compelled to omit a few\n",
      "yards of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may now proceed to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The great tournament was in full swing. All through the afternoon\n",
      "boiler-plated knights on mettlesome chargers had hurled themselves on\n",
      "each other's spears, to the vast contentment of all. Bright eyes shone;\n",
      "handkerchiefs fluttered; musical voices urged chosen champions to knock\n",
      "the cover off their brawny adversaries. The cheap seats had long since\n",
      "become hoarse with emotion. All round the arena rose the cries of\n",
      "itinerant merchants: 'Iced malvoisie,' 'Score-cards; ye cannot tell the\n",
      "jousters without a score-card.' All was revelry and excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hush fell on the throng. From either end of the arena a mounted\n",
      "knight in armour had entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The herald raised his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ladeez'n gemmen! Battling Galahad and Agravaine the Dolorous. Galahad\n",
      "on my right, Agravaine on my left. Squires out of the ring. Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "A speculator among the crowd offered six to one on Galahad, but found\n",
      "no takers. Nor was the public's caution without reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment later the two had met in a cloud of dust, and Agravaine,\n",
      "shooting over his horse's crupper, had fallen with a metallic clang.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked himself up, and limped slowly from the arena. He was not\n",
      "unused to this sort of thing. Indeed, nothing else had happened to him\n",
      "in his whole jousting career.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was that Sir Agravaine the Dolorous was out of his element at\n",
      "King Arthur's court, and he knew it. It was this knowledge that had\n",
      "given him that settled air of melancholy from which he derived his\n",
      "title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until I came upon this black-letter MS. I had been under the\n",
      "impression, like, I presume, everybody else, that every Knight of the\n",
      "Round Table was a model of physical strength and beauty. Malory says\n",
      "nothing to suggest the contrary. Nor does Tennyson. But apparently\n",
      "there were exceptions, of whom Sir Agravaine the Dolorous must have\n",
      "been the chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, it seems, nothing to mitigate this unfortunate man's\n",
      "physical deficiencies. There is a place in the world for the strong,\n",
      "ugly man, and there is a place for the weak, handsome man. But to fall\n",
      "short both in features and in muscle is to stake your all on brain. And\n",
      "in the days of King Arthur you did not find the populace turning out to\n",
      "do homage to brain. It was a drug on the market. Agravaine was a good\n",
      "deal better equipped than his contemporaries with grey matter, but his\n",
      "height in his socks was but five feet four; and his muscles, though he\n",
      "had taken three correspondence courses in physical culture, remained\n",
      "distressingly flaccid. His eyes were pale and mild, his nose snub, and\n",
      "his chin receded sharply from his lower lip, as if Nature, designing\n",
      "him, had had to leave off in a hurry and finish the job anyhow. The\n",
      "upper teeth, protruding, completed the resemblance to a nervous rabbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handicapped in this manner, it is no wonder that he should feel sad and\n",
      "lonely in King Arthur's court. At heart he ached for romance; but\n",
      "romance passed him by. The ladies of the court ignored his existence,\n",
      "while, as for those wandering damsels who came periodically to Camelot\n",
      "to complain of the behaviour of dragons, giants, and the like, and to\n",
      "ask permission of the king to take a knight back with them to fight\n",
      "their cause (just as, nowadays, one goes out and calls a policeman), he\n",
      "simply had no chance. The choice always fell on Lancelot or some other\n",
      "popular favourite.\n",

      "The tournament was followed by a feast. In those brave days almost\n",
      "everything was followed by a feast. The scene was gay and animated.\n",
      "Fair ladies, brave knights, churls, varlets, squires, scurvy knaves,\n",
      "men-at-arms, malapert rogues--all were merry. All save Agravaine. He\n",
      "sat silent and moody. To the jests of Dagonet he turned a deaf ear. And\n",
      "when his neighbour, Sir Kay, arguing with Sir Percivale on current\n",
      "form, appealed to him to back up his statement that Sir Gawain, though\n",
      "a workman-like middle-weight, lacked the punch, he did not answer,\n",
      "though the subject was one on which he held strong views. He sat on,\n",
      "brooding.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he sat there, a man-at-arms entered the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your majesty,' he cried, 'a damsel in distress waits without.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of excitement and interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Show her in,' said the king, beaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man-at-arms retired. Around the table the knights were struggling\n",
      "into an upright position in their seats and twirling their moustaches.\n",
      "Agravaine alone made no movement. He had been through this sort of\n",
      "thing so often. What were distressed damsels to him? His whole\n",
      "demeanour said, as plainly as if he had spoken the words, 'What's the\n",
      "use?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd at the door parted, and through the opening came a figure at\n",
      "the sight of whom the expectant faces of the knights turned pale with\n",
      "consternation. For the new-comer was quite the plainest girl those\n",
      "stately halls had ever seen. Possibly the only plain girl they had ever\n",
      "seen, for no instance is recorded in our authorities of the existence\n",
      "at that period of any such.\n",
      "\n",
      "The knights gazed at her blankly. Those were the grand old days of\n",
      "chivalry, when a thousand swords would leap from their scabbards to\n",
      "protect defenceless woman, if she were beautiful. The present seemed\n",
      "something in the nature of a special case, and nobody was quite certain\n",
      "as to the correct procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "An awkward silence was broken by the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Er--yes?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damsel halted.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your majesty,' she cried, 'I am in distress. I crave help!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Just so,' said the king, uneasily, flashing an apprehensive glance at\n",
      "the rows of perturbed faces before him. 'Just _so_. What--er--what is\n",
      "the exact nature of the--ah--trouble? Any assistance these gallant\n",
      "knights can render will, I am sure, be--ah--eagerly rendered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked imploringly at the silent warriors. As a rule, this speech\n",
      "was the signal for roars of applause. But now there was not even a\n",
      "murmur.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I may say enthusiastically,' he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Precisely,' said the king, ever tactful. 'And now--you were saying?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am Yvonne, the daughter of Earl Dorm of the Hills,' said the damsel,\n",
      "'and my father has sent me to ask protection from a gallant knight\n",
      "against a fiery dragon that ravages the country-side.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A dragon, gentlemen,' said the king, aside. It was usually a safe\n",
      "draw. Nothing pleased the knight of that time more than a brisk bout\n",
      "with a dragon. But now the tempting word was received in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fiery,' said the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some more silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king had recourse to the direct appeal. 'Sir Gawain, this Court\n",
      "would be greatly indebted to you if--'\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Gawain said he had strained a muscle at the last tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sir Pelleas.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The king's voice was growing flat with consternation. The situation was\n",
      "unprecedented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Pelleas said he had an ingrowing toe-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king's eye rolled in anguish around the table. Suddenly it stopped.\n",
      "It brightened. His look of dismay changed to one of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "A knight had risen to his feet. It was Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah!' said the king, drawing a deep breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Agravaine gulped. He was feeling more nervous than he had ever felt\n",
      "in his life. Never before had he risen to volunteer his services in a\n",
      "matter of this kind, and his state of mind was that of a small boy\n",
      "about to recite his first piece of poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not only the consciousness that every eye, except one of Sir\n",
      "Balin's which had been closed in the tournament that afternoon, was\n",
      "upon him. What made him feel like a mild gentleman in a post-office who\n",
      "has asked the lady assistant if she will have time to attend to him\n",
      "soon and has caught her eye, was the fact that he thought he had\n",
      "observed the damsel Yvonne frown as he rose. He groaned in spirit. This\n",
      "damsel, he felt, wanted the proper goods or none at all. She might not\n",
      "be able to get Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad; but she was not going to be\n",
      "satisfied with a half-portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact was that Sir Agravaine had fallen in love at first sight. The\n",
      "moment he had caught a glimpse of the damsel Yvonne, he loved her\n",
      "devotedly. To others she seemed plain and unattractive. To him she was\n",
      "a Queen of Beauty. He was amazed at the inexplicable attitude of the\n",
      "knights around him. He had expected them to rise in a body to clamour\n",
      "for the chance of assisting this radiant vision. He could hardly\n",
      "believe, even now, that he was positively the only starter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This is Sir Agravaine the Dolorous,' said the king to the damsel.\n",
      "'Will you take him as your champion?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine held his breath. But all was well. The damsel bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then, Sir Agravaine,' said the king, 'perhaps you had better have your\n",
      "charger sent round at once. I imagine that the matter is pressing--time\n",
      "and--er--dragons wait for no man.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes later Agravaine, still dazed, was jogging along to the\n",
      "hills, with the damsel by his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some time before either of them spoke. The damsel seemed\n",
      "preoccupied, and Agravaine's mind was a welter of confused thoughts,\n",
      "the most prominent of which and the one to which he kept returning\n",
      "being the startling reflection that he, who had pined for romance so\n",
      "long, had got it now in full measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dragon! Fiery withal. Was he absolutely certain that he was capable\n",
      "of handling an argument with a fiery dragon? He would have given much\n",
      "for a little previous experience of this sort of thing. It was too late\n",
      "now, but he wished he had had the forethought to get Merlin to put up a\n",
      "magic prescription for him, rendering him immune to dragon-bites. But\n",
      "did dragons bite? Or did they whack at you with their tails? Or just\n",
      "blow fire?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a dozen such points that he would have liked to have settled\n",
      "before starting. It was silly to start out on a venture of this sort\n",
      "without special knowledge. He had half a mind to plead a forgotten\n",
      "engagement and go straight back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked at the damsel, and his mind was made up. What did death\n",
      "matter if he could serve her?\n",
      "\n",
      "He coughed. She came out of her reverie with a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This dragon, now?' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the damsel did not reply. 'A fearsome worm, Sir Knight,'\n",
      "she said at length. 'It raveneth by day and by night. It breathes fire\n",
      "from its nostrils.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Does it!' said Agravaine. '_Does_ it! You couldn't give some\n",
      "idea what it looks like, what kind of _size_ it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Its body is as thick as ten stout trees, and its head touches the\n",
      "clouds.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Does it!' said Agravaine thoughtfully. '_Does_ it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, Sir Knight, I pray you have a care.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will,' said Agravaine. And he had seldom said anything more\n",
      "fervently. The future looked about as bad as it could be. Any hopes\n",
      "he may have entertained that this dragon might turn out to\n",
      "be comparatively small and inoffensive were dissipated. This was\n",
      "plainly no debilitated wreck of a dragon, its growth stunted by\n",
      "excessive-fire-breathing. A body as thick as ten stout trees! He would\n",
      "not even have the melancholy satisfaction of giving the creature\n",
      "indigestion. For all the impression he was likely to make on that vast\n",
      "interior, he might as well be a salted almond.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were speaking, a dim mass on the skyline began to take shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Behold!' said the damsel. 'My father's castle.' And presently they\n",
      "were riding across the drawbridge and through the great gate, which\n",
      "shut behind them with a clang.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they dismounted a man came out through a door at the farther end of\n",
      "the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father,' said Yvonne, 'this is the gallant knight Sir Agravaine, who\n",
      "has come to--' it seemed to Agravaine that she hesitated for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'To tackle our dragon?' said the father. 'Excellent. Come right in.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Earl Dorm of the Hills, was a small, elderly man, with what Agravaine\n",
      "considered a distinctly furtive air about him. His eyes were too close\n",
      "together, and he was over-lavish with a weak, cunning smile. Even\n",
      "Agravaine, who was in the mood to like the whole family, if possible,\n",
      "for Yvonne's sake, could not help feeling that appearances were against\n",
      "this particular exhibit. He might have a heart of gold beneath the\n",
      "outward aspect of a confidence-trick expert whose hobby was dog-stealing,\n",
      "but there was no doubt that his exterior did not inspire a genial glow\n",
      "of confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very good of you to come,' said the earl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a pleasure,' said Agravaine. 'I have been hearing all about the\n",
      "dragon.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A great scourge,' agreed his host. 'We must have a long talk about it\n",
      "after dinner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the custom in those days in the stately homes of England for the\n",
      "whole strength of the company to take their meals together. The guests\n",
      "sat at the upper table, the ladies in a gallery above them, while the\n",
      "usual drove of men-at-arms, archers, malapert rogues, varlets, scurvy\n",
      "knaves, scullions, and plug-uglies attached to all medieval households,\n",
      "squashed in near the door, wherever they could find room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retinue of Earl Dorm was not strong numerically--the household\n",
      "being, to judge from appearances, one that had seen better days; but it\n",
      "struck Agravaine that what it lacked in numbers it made up in\n",
      "toughness. Among all those at the bottom of the room there was not one\n",
      "whom it would have been agreeable to meet alone in a dark alley. Of\n",
      "all those foreheads not one achieved a height of more than one point\n",
      "nought four inches. A sinister collection, indeed, and one which,\n",
      "Agravaine felt, should have been capable of handling without his\n",
      "assistance any dragon that ever came into the world to stimulate the\n",
      "asbestos industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was roused from his reflections by the voice of his host.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I hope you are not tired after your journey, Sir Agravaine? My little\n",
      "girl did not bore you, I trust? We are very quiet folk here. Country\n",
      "mice. But we must try to make your visit interesting.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine felt that the dragon might be counted upon to do that. He\n",
      "said as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, yes, the dragon,' said Earl Dorm, 'I was forgetting the dragon. I\n",
      "want to have a long talk with you about that dragon. Not now. Later\n",
      "on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His eye caught Agravaine's, and he smiled that weak, cunning smile of\n",
      "his. And for the first time the knight was conscious of a curious\n",
      "feeling that all was not square and aboveboard in this castle. A\n",
      "conviction began to steal over him that in some way he was being played\n",
      "with, that some game was afoot which he did not understand, that--in a\n",
      "word--there was dirty work at the cross-roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a touch of mystery in the atmosphere which made him vaguely\n",
      "uneasy. When a fiery dragon is ravaging the country-side to such an\n",
      "extent that the S.O.S. call has been sent out to the Round Table, a\n",
      "knight has a right to expect the monster to be the main theme of\n",
      "conversation. The tendency on his host's part was apparently to avoid\n",
      "touching on the subject at all. He was vague and elusive; and the one\n",
      "topic on which an honest man is not vague and elusive is that of fiery\n",
      "dragons. It was not right. It was as if one should phone for the police\n",
      "and engage them, on arrival, in a discussion on the day's football\n",
      "results.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wave of distrust swept over Agravaine. He had heard stories of robber\n",
      "chiefs who lured strangers into their strongholds and then held them\n",
      "prisoners while the public nervously dodged their anxious friends who\n",
      "had formed subscription lists to make up the ransom. Could this be such\n",
      "a case? The man certainly had an evasive manner and a smile which would\n",
      "have justified any jury in returning a verdict without leaving the box.\n",
      "On the other hand, there was Yvonne. His reason revolted against the\n",
      "idea of that sweet girl being a party to any such conspiracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, probably it was only the Earl's unfortunate manner. Perhaps he\n",
      "suffered from some muscular weakness of the face which made him smile\n",
      "like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he certainly wished that he had not allowed himself to be\n",
      "deprived of his sword and armour. At the time it had seemed to him that\n",
      "the Earl's remark that the latter needed polishing and the former\n",
      "stropping betrayed only a kindly consideration for his guest's well-being.\n",
      "Now, it had the aspect of being part of a carefully-constructed plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand--here philosophy came to his rescue--if anybody did\n",
      "mean to start anything, his sword and armour might just as well not be\n",
      "there. Any one of those mammoth low-brows at the door could eat him,\n",
      "armour and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He resumed his meal, uneasy but resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner at Earl Dorm's was no lunch-counter scuffle. It started early\n",

      "conducted to his room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room which had been allotted to him was high up in the eastern\n",
      "tower. It was a nice room, but to one in Agravaine's state of\n",
      "suppressed suspicion a trifle too solidly upholstered. The door was of\n",
      "the thickest oak, studded with iron nails. Iron bars formed a neat\n",
      "pattern across the only window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had Agravaine observed these things when the door opened, and\n",
      "before him stood the damsel Yvonne, pale of face and panting for\n",

      "\n",
      "She leaned against the doorpost and gulped.\n",

      "retiring to your room had found the door kick-proof and the window\n",
      "barred, and if, immediately after your discovery of these phenomena, a\n",
      "white-faced young lady had plunged in upon you and urged you to\n",
      "immediate flight, wouldn't that jar you?\n",
      "\n",
      "It jarred Agravaine.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Fly! Fly, Sir Knight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Another footstep sounded in the passage. The damsel gave a startled\n",

      "\n",
      "'And what's all this?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Earl Dorm appeared in the dim-lit corridor. His voice had a nasty\n",
      "tinkle in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your--your daughter,' said Agravaine, hurriedly, 'was just telling me\n",
      "that breakfast would--'\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentence remained unfinished. A sudden movement of the earl's hand,\n",
      "and the great door banged in his face. There came the sound of a bolt\n",
      "shooting into its socket. A key turned in the lock. He was trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, the earl had seized his daughter by the wrist and was\n",
      "administering a paternal cross-examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What were you saying to him?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yvonne did not flinch.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was bidding him fly.'\n",

      "'If he wants to leave this castle,' said the earl, grimly, 'he'll have\n",
      "to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father,' said Yvonne,' I can't.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can't what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His grip on her wrist tightened. From the other side of the door came\n",
      "the muffled sound of blows on the solid oak. 'Oh?' said Earl Dorm.\n",
      "'You can't, eh? Well, listen to me. You've got to. Do you understand? I\n",
      "admit he might be better-looking, but--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father, I love him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He released her wrist, and stared at her in the uncertain light.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then what--? Why? Well, I never did understand women,' he said at\n",
      "last, and stumped off down the passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this cryptic conversation was in progress, Agravaine, his worst\n",
      "apprehensions realized, was trying to batter down the door. After a few\n",
      "moments, however, he realized the futility of his efforts, and sat down\n",
      "on the bed to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the risk of forfeiting the reader's respect, it must be admitted\n",
      "that his first emotion was one of profound relief. If he was locked up\n",
      "like this, it must mean that that dragon story was fictitious, and that\n",
      "all danger was at an end of having to pit his inexperience against a\n",
      "ravening monster who had spent a lifetime devouring knights. He had\n",
      "never liked the prospect, though he had been prepared to go through\n",
      "with it, and to feel that it was definitely cancelled made up for a\n",
      "good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mind next turned to his immediate future. What were they going to\n",
      "do with him? On this point he felt tolerably comfortable. This\n",
      "imprisonment could mean nothing more than that he would be compelled to\n",
      "disgorge a ransom. This did not trouble him. He was rich, and, now that\n",
      "the situation had been switched to a purely business basis, he felt\n",
      "that he could handle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, there was nothing to be gained by sitting up, so he went\n",
      "to bed, like a good philosopher.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was pouring through the barred window when he was awoken by the\n",
      "entrance of a gigantic figure bearing food and drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recognized him as one of the scurvy knaves who had dined at the\n",
      "bottom of the room the night before--a vast, beetle-browed fellow with\n",
      "a squint, a mop of red hair, and a genius for silence. To Agravaine's\n",
      "attempts to engage him in conversation he replied only with grunts, and\n",
      "in a short time left the room, closing and locking the door behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was succeeded at dusk by another of about the same size and\n",
      "ugliness, and with even less conversational _elan_. This one did\n",
      "not even grunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-talk, it seemed, was not an art cultivated in any great measure\n",
      "by the lower orders in the employment of Earl Dorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day passed without incident. In the morning the strabismic\n",
      "plug-ugly with the red hair brought him food and drink, while in the\n",
      "evening the non-grunter did the honours. It was a peaceful life, but\n",
      "tending towards monotony, and Agravaine was soon in the frame of mind\n",
      "which welcomes any break in the daily round.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was fortunate enough to get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had composed himself for sleep that night, and was just dropping\n",
      "comfortably off, when from the other side of the door he heard the\n",
      "sound of angry voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was enough to arouse him. On the previous night silence had reigned.\n",
      "Evidently something out of the ordinary was taking place.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened intently and distinguished words.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who was it I did see thee coming down the road with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who was it thou didst see me coming down the road with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aye, who was it I did see thee coming down the road with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who dost thou think thou art?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who do I think that I am?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aye, who dost thou think thou art?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine could make nothing of it. As a matter of fact, he was hearing\n",
      "the first genuine cross-talk that had ever occurred in those dim,\n",
      "pre-music-hall days. In years to come dialogue on these lines was to\n",
      "be popular throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain. But\n",
      "till then it had been unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voices grew angrier. To an initiated listener it would have been\n",
      "plain that in a short while words would be found inadequate and the\n",
      "dagger, that medieval forerunner of the slap-stick, brought into play.\n",
      "But to Agravaine, all inexperienced, it came as a surprise when\n",
      "suddenly with a muffled thud two bodies fell against the door. There\n",
      "was a scuffling noise, some groans, and then silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then with amazement he heard the bolt shoot back and a key grate in\n",
      "the keyhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door swung open. It was dark outside, but Agravaine could\n",
      "distinguish a female form, and, beyond, a shapeless mass which he took\n",
      "correctly to be the remains of the two plug-uglies.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is I, Yvonne,' said a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it? What has been happening?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was I. I set them against each other. They both loved one of the\n",
      "kitchen-maids. I made them jealous. I told Walt privily that she had\n",
      "favoured Dickon, and Dickon privily that she loved Walt. And now--'\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced at the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No wedding-bells for her,' he said, reverently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And I don't care. I did it to save you. But come! We are wasting time.\n",
      "Come! I will help you to escape.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A man who has been shut up for two days in a small room is seldom slow\n",
      "off the mark when a chance presents itself of taking exercise.\n",
      "Agravaine followed without a word, and together they crept down the\n",
      "dark staircase until they had reached the main hall. From somewhere in\n",
      "the distance came the rhythmic snores of scurvy knaves getting their\n",
      "eight hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Softly Yvonne unbolted a small door, and, passing through it, Agravaine\n",
      "found himself looking up at the stars, while the great walls of the\n",
      "castle towered above him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good-bye,' said Yvonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause. For the first time Agravaine found himself\n",
      "examining the exact position of affairs. After his sojourn in the\n",
      "guarded room, freedom looked very good to him. But freedom meant\n",
      "parting from Yvonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the sky and he looked at the castle walls, and he took a\n",
      "step back towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm not so sure I want to go,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, fly! Fly, Sir Knight!' she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You don't understand,' said Agravaine. 'I don't want to seem to be\n",
      "saying anything that might be interpreted as in the least derogatory to\n",
      "your father in any way whatever, but without prejudice, surely he is\n",
      "just a plain, ordinary brigand? I mean it's only a question of a\n",
      "ransom? And I don't in the least object--'\n",
      "\n",

      "She was silent. Then she began to speak rapidly. 'Very well. I will\n",
      "tell you. Listen. My father had six children, all daughters. We were\n",
      "poor. We had to stay buried in this out-of-the-way spot. We saw no one.\n",
      "It seemed impossible that any of us should ever marry. My father was in\n",
      "despair. Then he said, \"If we cannot get to town, the town must come to\n",
      "us.\" So he sent my sister Yseult to Camelot to ask the king to let us\n",
      "have a knight to protect us against a giant with three heads. There was\n",
      "no giant, but she got the knight. It was Sir Sagramore. Perhaps you\n",
      "knew him?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine nodded. He began to see daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My sister Yseult was very beautiful. After the first day Sir Sagramore\n",
      "forgot all about the giant, and seemed to want to do nothing else\n",
      "except have Yseult show him how to play cat's cradle. They were married\n",
      "two months later, and my father sent my sister Elaine to Camelot to\n",
      "ask for a knight to protect us against a wild unicorn.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And who bit?' asked Agravaine, deeply interested.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'I understand the main idea,' said Agravaine. 'But in my case--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You were to marry me,' said Yvonne. Her voice was quiet and cold, but\n",
      "she was quivering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine was conscious of a dull, heavy weight pressing on his heart.\n",
      "He had known his love was hopeless, but even hopelessness is the better\n",
      "for being indefinite. He understood now.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And you naturally want to get rid of me before it can happen,' he\n",
      "said. 'I don't wonder. I'm not vain... Well, I'll go. I knew I had no\n",
      "chance. Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned. She stopped him with a sharp cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you mean? You cannot wish to stay now? I am saving you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Saving me! I have loved you since the moment you entered the Hall at\n",
      "Camelot,' said Agravaine.\n",

      "She drew in her breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You--you love me!'\n",

      "\n",
      "She drooped towards him, and he gathered her into his arms. For a\n",
      "novice, he did it uncommonly well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about six months later that Agravaine, having ridden into the\n",
      "forest, called upon a Wise Man at his cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In those days almost anyone who was not a perfect bonehead could set up\n",
      "as a Wise Man and get away with it. All you had to do was to live in a\n",
      "forest and grow a white beard. This particular Wise Man, for a wonder,\n",
      "had a certain amount of rude sagacity. He listened carefully to what\n",
      "the knight had to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It has puzzled me to such an extent,' said Agravaine, 'that I felt\n",
      "that I must consult a specialist. You see me. Take a good look at me.\n",
      "What do you think of my personal appearance? You needn't hesitate. It's\n",
      "worse than that. I am the ugliest man in England.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you go as far as that?' said the Wise Man, politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Farther. And everybody else thinks so. Everybody except my wife. She\n",
      "tells me that I am a model of manly beauty. You know Lancelot? Well,\n",
      "she says I have Lancelot whipped to a custard. What do you make of\n",
      "that? And here's another thing. It is perfectly obvious to me that my\n",
      "wife is one of the most beautiful creatures in existence. I have seen\n",
      "them all, and I tell you that she stands alone. She is literally\n",
      "marooned in Class A, all by herself. Yet she insists that she is plain.\n",
      "What do you make of it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wise Man stroked his beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My son,' he said, 'the matter is simple. True love takes no account of\n",
      "looks.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No?' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You two are affinities. Therefore, to you the outward aspect is nothing.\n",
      "Put it like this. Love is a thingummybob who what-d'you-call-its.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm beginning to see,' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I meant was this. Love is a wizard greater than Merlin. He plays\n",
      "odd tricks with the eyesight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Or, put it another way. Love is a sculptor greater than Praxiteles. He\n",
      "takes an unsightly piece of clay and moulds it into a thing divine.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I get you,' said Agravaine.\n",

      "The Wise Man began to warm to his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Or shall we say--'\n",

      "\n",

      "it is true, was something of a drawback. He was a rugged old tainted\n",
      "millionaire of the old school, with a fondness for shirt-sleeves and a\n",
      "tendency to give undue publicity to toothpicks. But he had been made to\n",
      "understand at an early date that the dead-line for him was the farther\n",

      "the sofa. Clarence was too well-bred to make any comment. A true\n",
      "Runnymede, he affected to notice nothing, and, picking up the evening\n",
      "paper, began to read. The announcement of his engagement could be\n",
      "postponed to a more suitable time.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Clarence!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his mother who spoke. Her voice seemed to rip the air into a\n",

      "than a Chicago voice raised in excitement or anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mother?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Never mind your pop and his old veto. He didn't know he had one till\n",

      "\n",
      "Clarence looked at her inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ruined much?' he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bed-rock,' said his mother. 'If we have sixty thousand dollars a year\n",
      "after this, it's all we shall have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A low howl escaped from the stricken old man on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence betrayed no emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah,' he said, calmly. 'How did it happen?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've just had a cable from Chicago, from your grand-pop. He's been\n",
      "trying to corner wheat. He always was an impulsive old gazook.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But surely,' said Clarence, a dim recollection of something he had\n",
      "heard or read somewhere coming to him, 'isn't cornering wheat a rather\n",
      "profitable process?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure,' said his mother. 'Sure it is. I guess dad's try at cornering\n",
      "wheat was about the most profitable thing that ever happened--to the\n",
      "other fellows. It seems like they got busy and clubbed fifty-seven\n",
      "varieties of Hades out of your old grand-pop. He's got to give up a lot\n",
      "of his expensive habits, and one of them is sending money to us. That's\n",
      "how it is.'\n",

      "\n",
      "His mother crisply revised his pronouns.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Work?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Work.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence drew a deep breath.\n",
      "\n",

      "thoughtfully. 'I was lunching with a man at the Bachelor's only\n",
      "yesterday who swore he knew a fellow who had met a man whose cousin\n",
      "worked. But I don't see what I could do, don't you know.'\n",

      "'Well, I can play footer. By Jove, I'll sign on as a pro. I'll take a\n",

      "club will jump at me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was no idle boast. Since early childhood Clarence had concentrated\n",
      "his energies on becoming a footballer, and was now an exceedingly fine\n",
      "goal-keeper. It was a pleasing sight to see him, poised on one foot in\n",
      "the attitude of a Salome dancer, with one eye on the man with the ball,\n",
      "the other gazing coldly on the rest of the opposition forward line,\n",
      "uncurl abruptly like the main-spring of a watch and stop a hot one.\n",
      "Clarence in goal was the nearest approach to an india-rubber acrobat\n",
      "and society contortionist to be seen off the music-hall stage. He was,\n",
      "in brief, hot stuff. He had the goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely had he uttered these momentous words when the butler entered\n",
      "with the announcement that he was wanted by a lady on the telephone.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Clarence, a terrible thing has happened. I told papa of our\n",

      "Clarence, as he had predicted, found no difficulty in obtaining\n",
      "employment. He was signed on at once, under the name of Jones, by\n",
      "Houndsditch Wednesday, the premier metropolitan club, and embarked at\n",
      "once on his new career.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season during which Clarence Tresillian kept goal for Houndsditch\n",
      "Wednesday is destined to live long in the memory of followers of\n",
      "professional football. Probably never in the history of the game has\n",
      "there been such persistent and widespread mortality among the more\n",
      "distant relatives of office-boys and junior clerks. Statisticians have\n",
      "estimated that if all the grandmothers alone who perished between the\n",
      "months of September and April that season could have been placed end to\n",
      "end, they would have reached from Hyde Park Corner to the outskirts of\n",
      "Manchester. And it was Clarence who was responsible for this\n",
      "holocaust. Previous to the opening of the season sceptics had shaken\n",
      "their heads over the Wednesday's chances in the First League. Other\n",
      "clubs had bought up the best men in the market, leaving only a mixed\n",
      "assortment of inferior Scotsmen, Irishmen, and Northcountrymen to\n",
      "uphold the honour of the London club.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, like a meteor, Clarence Tresillian had flashed upon the world\n",
      "of football. In the opening game he had behaved in the goal-mouth like\n",
      "a Chinese cracker, and exhibited an absolutely impassable defence; and\n",
      "from then onward, except for an occasional check, Houndsditch Wednesday\n",
      "had never looked back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the spectators who flocked to the Houndsditch ground to watch\n",
      "Clarence perform there appeared week after week a little, grey, dried-up\n",
      "man, insignificant except for a certain happy choice of language in\n",
      "moments of emotion and an enthusiasm far surpassing that of the\n",
      "ordinary spectator. To the trained eye there are subtle distinctions\n",
      "between football enthusiasts. This man belonged to the comparatively\n",
      "small class of those who have football on the cerebrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fate had made Daniel Rackstraw a millionaire and a Radical, but at\n",
      "heart he was a spectator of football. He never missed a match. His\n",
      "library of football literature was the finest in the country. His\n",
      "football museum had but one equal, that of Mr Jacob Dodson, of\n",
      "Manchester. Between them the two had cornered, at enormous expense, the\n",
      "curio market of the game. It was Rackstraw who had secured the\n",
      "authentic pair of boots in which Bloomer had first played for England;\n",
      "but it was Dodson who possessed the painted india-rubber ball used by\n",
      "Meredith when a boy--probably the first thing except a nurse ever\n",
      "kicked by that talented foot. The two men were friends, as far as rival\n",
      "connoisseurs can be friends; and Mr Dodson, when at leisure, would\n",
      "frequently pay a visit to Mr Rackstraw's country house, where he would\n",
      "spend hours gazing wistfully at the Bloomer boots, buoyed up only by\n",
      "the thoughts of the Meredith ball at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabel saw little of Clarence during the winter months, except from a\n",
      "distance. She contented herself with clipping photographs of him from\n",
      "the sporting papers. Each was a little more unlike him than the last,\n",
      "and this lent variety to the collection. Her father marked her new-born\n",
      "enthusiasm for the game with approval. It had been secretly a great\n",
      "grief to the old gentleman that his only child did not know the\n",
      "difference between a linesman and an inside right, and, more, did not\n",
      "seem to care to know. He felt himself drawn closer to her. An\n",
      "understanding, as pleasant as it was new and strange, began to spring\n",
      "up between parent and child.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Clarence, how easy it would be to haul up one's slacks to\n",
      "practically an unlimited extent on the subject of his emotions at this\n",
      "time. One can figure him, after the game is over and the gay throng has\n",
      "dispersed, creeping moodily--but what's the use? Brevity--that is the\n",
      "cry. Brevity. Let us on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The months sped by; the Cup-ties began, and soon it was evident that\n",
      "the Final must be fought out between Houndsditch Wednesday and Mr Jacob\n",
      "Dodson's pet team, Manchester United. With each match the Wednesday\n",
      "seemed to improve. Clarence was a Gibraltar among goal-keepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were delirious days for Daniel Rackstraw. Long before the fourth\n",
      "round his voice had dwindled to a husky whisper. Deep lines appeared on\n",
      "his forehead; for it is an awful thing for a football enthusiast to be\n",
      "compelled to applaud, in the very middle of the Cup-ties, purely by\n",
      "means of facial expression. In this time of affliction he found Isabel\n",
      "an ever-increasing comfort to him. Side by side they would sit, and the\n",
      "old man's face would lose its drawn look, and light up, as her clear\n",
      "young soprano pealed out over the din, urging this player to shoot,\n",
      "that to kick some opponent in the face; or describing the referee in no\n",
      "uncertain terms as a reincarnation of the late Mr Dick Turpin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the day of the Final at the Crystal Palace approached, and all\n",
      "England was alert, confident of a record-breaking contest. But alas!\n",
      "How truly does Epictetus observe: 'We know not what awaiteth us round\n",
      "the corner, and the hand that counteth its chickens ere they be hatched\n",
      "oft-times doth but step on the banana-skin.' The prophets who\n",
      "anticipated a struggle keener than any in football history were\n",
      "destined to be proved false.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not that their judgement of form was at fault. On the run of the\n",
      "season's play Houndsditch Wednesday _v_. Manchester United should\n",
      "have been the two most evenly-matched teams in the history of the game.\n",
      "Forward, the latter held a slight superiority; but this was balanced by\n",
      "the inspired goal-keeping of Clarence Tresillian. Even the keenest\n",
      "supporters of either side were not confident. They argued at length,\n",
      "figuring out the odds with the aid of stubs of pencils and the backs of\n",
      "envelopes, but they were not confident. Out of all those frenzied\n",
      "millions two men alone had no doubts. Mr Daniel Rackstraw said that he\n",
      "did not desire to be unfair to Manchester United. He wished it to be\n",
      "clearly understood that in their own class Manchester United might\n",
      "quite possibly show to considerable advantage. In some rural league,\n",
      "for instance, he did not deny that they might sweep all before them.\n",
      "But when it came to competing with Houndsditch Wednesday--here words\n",
      "failed Mr Rackstraw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Jacob Dodson, interviewed by the _Manchester Weekly Football\n",
      "Boot_, stated that his decision, arrived at after a close and\n",
      "careful study of the work of both teams, was that Houndsditch Wednesday\n",
      "had rather less chance in the forthcoming tourney than a stuffed rat in\n",
      "the Battersea Dogs' Home. It was his carefully-considered opinion that\n",
      "in a contest with the second eleven of a village Church Lads' Brigade,\n",
      "Houndsditch Wednesday might, with an effort (conceding them that slice\n",
      "of luck which so often turns the tide of a game), scrape home. But when\n",
      "it was a question of meeting a team like Manchester United--here Mr\n",
      "Dodson, shrugging his shoulders despairingly, sank back in his chair,\n",
      "and watchful secretaries brought him round with oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the whole country nothing but the approaching match was\n",
      "discussed. Wherever civilization reigned, and in portions of Liverpool,\n",
      "one question alone was on every lip: Who would win? Octogenarians\n",
      "mumbled it. Infants lisped it. Tired City men, trampled under foot in\n",
      "the rush for their tram, asked it of the ambulance attendants who\n",
      "carried them to the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, one bright, clear morning, when the birds sang and all Nature\n",
      "seemed fair and gay, Clarence Tresillian developed mumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "London was in a ferment. I could have wished to go into details, to\n",
      "describe in crisp, burning sentences the panic that swept like a\n",
      "tornado through a million homes. A little encouragement, the slightest\n",
      "softening of the editorial austerity and the thing would have been\n",
      "done. But no. Brevity. That was the cry. Brevity. Let us on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Houndsditch Wednesday met Manchester United at the Crystal Palace, and\n",
      "for nearly two hours the sweat of agony trickled unceasingly down the\n",
      "corrugated foreheads of the patriots in the stands. The men from\n",
      "Manchester, freed from the fear of Clarence, smiled grim smiles and\n",
      "proceeded to pile up points. It was in vain that the Houndsditch backs\n",
      "and halfbacks skimmed like swallows about the field. They could not\n",
      "keep the score down. From start to finish Houndsditch were a beaten\n",
      "side.\n",
      "\n",
      "London during that black period was a desert. Gloom gripped the City.\n",
      "In distant Brixton red-eyed wives faced silently-scowling husbands at\n",
      "the evening meal, and the children were sent early to bed. Newsboys\n",
      "called the extras in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few took the tragedy more nearly to heart than Daniel Rackstraw.\n",

      "Now, Mr Dodson was perhaps the slightest bit shy on the finer feelings.\n",
      "He should have respected the grief of a fallen foe. He should have\n",
      "abstained from exulting. But he was in too exhilarated a condition to\n",
      "be magnanimous. Sighting Mr Rackstraw, he addressed himself joyously to\n",
      "the task of rubbing the thing in. Mr Rackstraw listened in silent\n",
      "anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If we had had Jones--' he said at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's what they all say,' whooped Mr Dodson, 'Jones! Who's Jones?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If we had had Jones, we should have--' He paused. An idea had flashed\n",
      "upon his overwrought mind. 'Dodson,' he said, 'look here. Wait till\n",
      "Jones is well again, and let us play this thing off again for anything\n",
      "you like a side in my private park.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "your Meredith ball. Does that go?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I should say it did,' said Mr Dodson, joyfully. 'I've been wanting\n",
      "that boot for years. It's like finding it in one's Christmas stocking.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very well,' said Mr Rackstraw. 'Then let's get it fixed up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, it is but a dog's life, that of the short-story writer. I\n",
      "particularly wished at this point to introduce a description of Mr\n",
      "Rackstraw's country house and estate, featuring the private football\n",
      "ground with its fringe of noble trees. It would have served a double\n",
      "purpose, not only charming the lover of nature, but acting as a fine\n",
      "stimulus to the youth of the country, showing them the sort of home\n",
      "they would be able to buy some day if they worked hard and saved their\n",
      "money. But no. You shall have three guesses as to what was the cry. You\n",
      "give it up? It was Brevity--brevity! Let us on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two teams arrived at Mr Rackstraw's house in time for lunch.\n",
      "Clarence, his features once more reduced to their customary\n",
      "finely-chiselled proportions, alighted from the automobile with a\n",
      "swelling heart. Presently he found an opportunity to slip away and\n",
      "meet Isabel. I will pass lightly over the meeting of the two lovers.\n",
      "I will not describe the dewy softness of their eyes, the catching of\n",
      "their breath, their murmured endearments. I could, mind you. It is at\n",
      "just such descriptions that I am particularly happy. But I have grown\n",
      "discouraged. My spirit is broken. It is enough to say that Clarence had\n",
      "reached a level of emotional eloquence rarely met with among goal-keepers\n",
      "of the First League, when Isabel broke from him with a startled\n",
      "exclamation, and vanished; and, looking over his shoulder, Clarence\n",
      "observed Mr Daniel Rackstraw moving towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident from the millionaire's demeanour that he had seen\n",
      "nothing. The look on his face was anxious, but not wrathful. He\n",

      "\n",
      "'Jones,' he said, 'I've been looking for you. I want a word with you.'\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In Alcala, as in most of New York's apartment houses, the schedule of\n",
      "prices is like a badly rolled cigarette--thick in the middle and thin\n",
      "at both ends. The rooms half-way up are expensive; some of them almost\n",
      "as expensive as if Fashion, instead of being gone for ever, were still\n",
      "lingering. The top rooms are cheap, the ground-floor rooms cheaper\n",
      "still.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheapest of all was the hall-bedroom. Its furniture was of the\n",
      "simplest. It consisted of a chair, another chair, a worn carpet, and a\n",
      "folding-bed. The folding-bed had an air of depression and baffled\n",
      "hopes. For years it had been trying to look like a bookcase in the\n",
      "daytime, and now it looked more like a folding-bed than ever. There\n",
      "was also a plain deal table, much stained with ink. At this, night\n",
      "after night, sometimes far into the morning, Rutherford Maxwell would\n",
      "sit and write stories. Now and then it happened that one would be a\n",
      "good story, and find a market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rutherford Maxwell was an Englishman, and the younger son of an\n",
      "Englishman; and his lot was the lot of the younger sons all the world\n",
      "over. He was by profession one of the numerous employees of the New\n",
      "Asiatic Bank, which has its branches all over the world. It is a sound,\n",
      "trustworthy institution, and steady-going relatives would assure\n",
      "Rutherford that he was lucky to have got a berth in it. Rutherford did\n",
      "not agree with them. However sound and trustworthy, it was not exactly\n",
      "romantic. Nor did it err on the side of over-lavishness to those who\n",
      "served it. Rutherford's salary was small. So were his prospects--if he\n",
      "remained in the bank. At a very early date he had registered a vow that\n",
      "he would not. And the road that led out of it for him was the uphill\n",
      "road of literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thankful for small mercies. Fate had not been over-kind up to\n",
      "the present, but at least she had dispatched him to New York, the\n",
      "centre of things, where he would have the chance to try, instead of to\n",
      "some spot off the map. Whether he won or lost, at any rate he was in\n",
      "the ring, and could fight. So every night he sat in Alcala, and wrote.\n",
      "Sometimes he would only try to write, and that was torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is never an hour of the day or night when Alcala is wholly\n",
      "asleep. The middle of the house is a sort of chorus-girl belt, while in\n",
      "the upper rooms there are reporters and other nightbirds. Long after he\n",
      "had gone to bed, Rutherford would hear footsteps passing his door and\n",
      "the sound of voices in the passage. He grew to welcome them. They\n",
      "seemed to connect him with the outer world. But for them he was alone\n",
      "after he had left the office, utterly alone, as it is possible to be\n",
      "only in the heart of a great city. Some nights he would hear scraps of\n",
      "conversations, at rare intervals a name. He used to build up in his\n",
      "mind identities for the owners of the names. One in particular, Peggy,\n",
      "gave him much food for thought. He pictured her as bright and\n",
      "vivacious. This was because she sang sometimes as she passed his door.\n",
      "She had been singing when he first heard her name. 'Oh, cut it out,\n",
      "Peggy,' a girl's voice had said. 'Don't you get enough of that tune at\n",
      "the theatre?' He felt that he would like to meet Peggy.\n",

      "June came, and July, making an oven of New York, bringing close,\n",
      "scorching days and nights when the pen seemed made of lead; and still\n",

      "filling the sheets of paper slowly, but with a dogged persistence which\n",
      "the weather could not kill. Despite the heat, he was cheerful. Things\n",
      "were beginning to run his way a little now. A novelette, an airy\n",
      "trifle, conceived in days when the thermometer was lower and it was\n",
      "possible to think, and worked out almost mechanically, had been\n",
      "accepted by a magazine of a higher standing than those which hitherto\n",
      "had shown him hospitality. He began to dream of a holiday in the woods.\n",
      "The holiday spirit was abroad. Alcala was emptying itself. It would not\n",
      "be long before he too would be able to get away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so deep in his thoughts that at first he did not hear the\n",
      "knocking at the door. But it was a sharp, insistent knocking, and\n",
      "forced itself upon his attention. He got up and turned the handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside in the passage was standing a girl, tall and sleepy-eyed. She\n",
      "wore a picture-hat and a costume the keynote of which was a certain\n",
      "aggressive attractiveness. There was no room for doubt as to which\n",
      "particular brand of scent was her favourite at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gazed at Rutherford dully. Like Banquo's ghost, she had no\n",
      "speculation in her eyes. Rutherford looked at her inquiringly, somewhat\n",
      "conscious of his shirt-sleeves.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you knock?' he said, opening, as a man must do, with the\n",
      "inevitable foolish question.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The intellectual pressure of the conversation was beginning to be a\n",
      "little too much for Rutherford. Combined with the heat of the night it\n",
      "made his head swim.\n",
      "\n",
      "His visitor advanced into the room. Arriving at the table, she began\n",
      "fiddling with its contents. The pen seemed to fascinate her. She picked\n",
      "it up and inspected it closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Say, what d'you call this?' she said.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Oh!' A pause. 'Say, got a cigarette?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Rutherford clutched a chair with one hand, and his forehead with the\n",
      "other. He was in sore straits.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Rescue arrived, not before it was needed. A brisk sound\n",
      "of footsteps in the passage, and there appeared in the doorway a second\n",
      "girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you think you're doing, Gladys?' demanded the new-comer. 'You\n",
      "mustn't come butting into folks' rooms this way. Who's your friend?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My name is Maxwell,' began Rutherford eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What say, Peggy?' said the seeker after cigarettes, dropping a sheet\n",
      "of manuscript to the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rutherford looked at the girl in the doorway with interest. So this was\n",
      "Peggy. She was little, and trim of figure. That was how he had always\n",
      "imagined her. Her dress was simpler than the other's. The face beneath\n",
      "the picture-hat was small and well-shaped, the nose delicately\n",
      "tip-tilted, the chin determined, the mouth a little wide and suggesting\n",
      "good-humour. A pair of grey eyes looked steadily into his before\n",
      "transferring themselves to the statuesque being at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't monkey with the man's inkwell, Gladys. Come along up to bed.'\n",

      "\n",
      "'There's plenty upstairs. Come along.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The other went with perfect docility. At the door she paused, and\n",
      "inspected Rutherford with a grave stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good night, boy!' she said, with haughty condescension.\n",
      "\n",

      "2\n",
      "\n",
      "He had lit his pipe, and was re-reading his night's work preparatory to\n",

      "\n",
      "'This'll do for me,' she said. 'Thought I'd just look in. I'm sorry\n",

      "golden fortnight of fresh air and sunshine in the Catskills, and was\n",
      "back in Alcala, trying with poor success, to pick up the threads of his\n",
      "work. But though the Indian Summer had begun, and there was energy in\n",
      "the air, night after night he sat idle in his room; night after night\n",
      "went wearily to bed, oppressed with a dull sense of failure. He could\n",
      "not work. He was restless. His thoughts would not concentrate\n",
      "themselves. Something was wrong; and he knew what it was, though he\n",
      "fought against admitting it to himself. It was the absence of Peggy\n",
      "that had brought about the change. Not till now had he realized to the\n",
      "full how greatly her visits had stimulated him. He had called her\n",
      "laughingly his mascot; but the thing was no joke. It was true. Her\n",
      "absence was robbing him of the power to write.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was lonely. For the first time since he had come to New York he was\n",
      "really lonely. Solitude had not hurt him till now. In his black moments\n",
      "it had been enough for him to look up at the photograph on the\n",
      "mantelpiece, and instantly he was alone no longer. But now the\n",
      "photograph had lost its magic. It could not hold him. Always his mind\n",
      "would wander back to the little, black-haired ghost that sat on the\n",
      "table, smiling at him, and questioning him with its grey eyes.\n",
      "\n",

      "sat on the table, smiling at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Fall came the reopening of the theatres. One by one the\n",
      "electric signs blazed out along Broadway, spreading the message that\n",
      "the dull days were over, and New York was itself again. At the Melody,\n",
      "where ages ago _The Island of Girls_ had run its light-hearted\n",
      "course, a new musical piece was in rehearsal. Alcala was full once\n",
      "more. The nightly snatches of conversation outside his door had\n",
      "recommenced. He listened for her voice, but he never heard it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat up, waiting, into the small hours, but she did not come. Once he\n",
      "had been trying to write, and had fallen, as usual, to brooding--there\n",
      "was a soft knock at the door. In an instant he had bounded from his\n",
      "chair, and turned the handle. It was one of the reporters from\n",
      "upstairs, who had run out of matches. Rutherford gave him a handful.\n",
      "The reporter went out, wondering what the man had laughed at.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is balm in Broadway, especially by night. Depression vanishes\n",
      "before the cheerfulness of the great white way when the lights are lit\n",
      "and the human tide is in full flood. Rutherford had developed of late a\n",
      "habit of patrolling the neighbourhood of Forty-Second Street at\n",
      "theatre-time. He found it did him good. There is a gaiety, a bonhomie,\n",
      "in the atmosphere of the New York streets. Rutherford loved to stand on\n",
      "the sidewalk and watch the passers-by, weaving stories round them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night his wanderings had brought him to Herald Square. The theatres\n",
      "were just emptying themselves. This was the time he liked best. He drew\n",
      "to one side to watch, and as he moved he saw Peggy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was standing at the corner, buttoning a glove. He was by her side\n",
      "in an instant.\n",

      "'Peggy!' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking pale and tired, but the colour came back to her cheeks\n",
      "as she held out her hand. There was no trace of embarrassment in her\n",
      "manner; only a frank pleasure at seeing him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where have you been?' he said. 'I couldn't think what had become of\n",
      "you.'\n",

      "it's good seeing you again! Can you walk as far as Rector's, or shall I\n",
      "carry you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Guess I can walk that far. But Rector's? Has your rich uncle died and\n",

      "\n",

      "never so much as dreamed of.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed to know Peggy at Rector's. Paul, the head waiter, beamed\n",
      "upon her paternally. One or two men turned and looked after her as she\n",
      "passed. The waiters smiled slight but friendly smiles. Rutherford,\n",
      "intent on her, noticed none of these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite her protests, he ordered an elaborate and expensive supper. He\n",
      "was particular about the wine. The waiter, who had been doubtful about\n",
      "him, was won over, and went off to execute the order, reflecting that\n",
      "it was never safe to judge a man by his clothes, and that Rutherford\n",
      "was probably one of these eccentric young millionaires who didn't care\n",
      "how they dressed.\n",

      "\n",

      "He had no real individuality. But Willie in the play! He felt that he\n",
      "would recognize him in the street. There was all the difference between\n",
      "the two that there is between a nameless figure in some cheap picture\n",
      "and a portrait by Sargent. There were times when the story of the play\n",
      "seemed thin to him, and the other characters wooden, but in his\n",
      "blackest moods he was sure of Willie. All the contradictions in the\n",
      "character rang true: the humour, the pathos, the surface vanity\n",

      "uproarious supper, at which everybody seemed to be congratulating\n",
      "everybody else. Men he had never met before shook him warmly by the\n",
      "hand. Somebody made a speech, despite the efforts of the rest of the\n",

      "THE MAN UPSTAIRS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three distinct stages in the evolution of Annette Brougham's\n",
      "attitude towards the knocking in the room above. In the beginning it\n",
      "had been merely a vague discomfort. Absorbed in the composition of her\n",
      "waltz, she had heard it almost subconsciously. The second stage set in\n",
      "when it became a physical pain like red-hot pincers wrenching her mind\n",
      "from her music. Finally, with a thrill in indignation, she knew it for\n",
      "what it was--an insult. The unseen brute disliked her playing, and was\n",
      "intimating his views with a boot-heel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defiantly, with her foot on the loud pedal, she struck--almost\n",
      "slapped--the keys once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bang!' from the room above. 'Bang! Bang!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette rose. Her face was pink, her chin tilted. Her eyes sparkled\n",
      "with the light of battle. She left the room and started to mount the\n",
      "stairs. No spectator, however just, could have helped feeling a pang of\n",
      "pity for the wretched man who stood unconscious of imminent doom,\n",
      "possibly even triumphant, behind the door at which she was on the point\n",
      "of tapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come in!' cried the voice, rather a pleasant voice; but what is a\n",
      "pleasant voice if the soul be vile?\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette went in. The room was a typical Chelsea studio, scantily\n",
      "furnished and lacking a carpet. In the centre was an easel, behind\n",
      "which were visible a pair of trousered legs. A cloud of grey smoke was\n",
      "curling up over the top of the easel.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I beg your pardon,' began Annette.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't want any models at present,' said the Brute. 'Leave your card\n",
      "on the table.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am not a model,' said Annette, coldly. 'I merely came--'\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the Brute emerged from his fortifications and, removing his\n",
      "pipe from his mouth, jerked his chair out into the open.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I beg your pardon,' he said. 'Won't you sit down?'\n",
      "\n",
      "How reckless is Nature in the distribution of her gifts! Not only had\n",
      "this black-hearted knocker on floors a pleasant voice, but, in\n",
      "addition, a pleasing exterior. He was slightly dishevelled at the\n",
      "moment, and his hair stood up in a disordered mop; but in spite of\n",
      "these drawbacks, he was quite passably good-looking. Annette admitted\n",
      "this. Though wrathful, she was fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought it was another model,' he explained. 'They've been coming in\n",
      "at the rate of ten an hour ever since I settled here. I didn't object\n",
      "at first, but after about the eightieth child of sunny Italy had shown\n",
      "up it began to get on my nerves.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette waited coldly till he had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am sorry,' she said, in a this-is-where-you-get-yours voice, 'if my\n",
      "playing disturbed you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "One would have thought nobody but an Eskimo wearing his furs and winter\n",
      "under-clothing could have withstood the iciness of her manner; but the\n",
      "Brute did not freeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am sorry,' repeated Annette, well below zero, 'if my playing\n",
      "disturbed you. I live in the room below, and I heard you knocking.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, no,' protested the young man, affably; 'I like it. Really I do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then why knock on the floor?' said Annette, turning to go. 'It is so\n",
      "bad for my ceiling,' she said over shoulder. 'I thought you would not\n",
      "mind my mentioning it. Good afternoon.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No; but one moment. Don't go.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped. He was surveying her with a friendly smile. She noticed\n",
      "most reluctantly that he had a nice smile. His composure began to\n",
      "enrage her more and more. Long ere this he should have been writhing at\n",
      "her feet in the dust, crushed and abject.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You see,' he said, 'I'm awfully sorry, but it's like this. I love\n",
      "music, but what I mean is, you weren't playing a _tune_. It was\n",
      "just the same bit over and over again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was trying to get a phrase,' said Annette, with dignity, but less\n",
      "coldly. In spite of herself she was beginning to thaw. There was\n",
      "something singularly attractive about this shock-headed youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A phrase?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of music. For my waltz. I am composing a waltz.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A look of such unqualified admiration overspread the young man's face\n",
      "that the last remnants of the ice-pack melted. For the first time since\n",
      "they had met Annette found herself positively liking this blackguardly\n",
      "floor-smiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can you compose music?' he said, impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have written one or two songs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It must be great to be able to do things--artistic things, I mean,\n",
      "like composing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, you do, don't you? You paint.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man shook his head with a cheerful grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I fancy,' he said, 'I should make a pretty good house-painter. I want\n",
      "scope. Canvas seems to cramp me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to cause him no discomfort. He appeared rather amused than\n",
      "otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Let me look.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She crossed over to the easel.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shouldn't,' he warned her. 'You really want to? Is this not mere\n",
      "recklessness? Very well, then.'\n",
      "\n",
      "To the eye of an experienced critic the picture would certainly have\n",
      "seemed crude. It was a study of a dark-eyed child holding a large black\n",
      "cat. Statisticians estimate that there is no moment during the day when\n",
      "one or more young artists somewhere on the face of the globe are not\n",
      "painting pictures of children holding cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I call it \"Child and Cat\",' said the young man. 'Rather a neat title,\n",
      "don't you think? Gives you the main idea of the thing right away.\n",
      "That,' he explained, pointing obligingly with the stem of his pipe, 'is\n",
      "the cat.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette belonged to that large section of the public which likes or\n",
      "dislikes a picture according to whether its subject happens to please\n",
      "or displease them. Probably there was not one of the million or so\n",
      "child-and-cat eyesores at present in existence which she would not have\n",
      "liked. Besides, he had been very nice about her music.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think it's splendid,' she announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man's face displayed almost more surprise than joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you really?' he said. 'Then I can die happy--that is, if you'll let\n",
      "me come down and listen to those songs of yours first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You would only knock on the floor,' objected Annette.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll never knock on another floor as long as I live,' said the\n",
      "ex-brute, reassuringly. 'I hate knocking on floors. I don't see\n",
      "what people want to knock on floors _for_, anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Friendships ripen quickly in Chelsea. Within the space of an hour and a\n",
      "quarter Annette had learned that the young man's name was Alan Beverley\n",
      "(for which Family Heraldic affliction she pitied rather than despised\n",
      "him), that he did not depend entirely on his work for a living, having\n",
      "a little money of his own, and that he considered this a fortunate\n",
      "thing. From the very beginning of their talk he pleased her. She found\n",
      "him an absolutely new and original variety of the unsuccessful painter.\n",
      "Unlike Reginald Sellers, who had a studio in the same building, and\n",
      "sometimes dropped in to drink her coffee and pour out his troubles, he\n",
      "did not attribute his non-success to any malice or stupidity on the\n",
      "part of the public. She was so used to hearing Sellers lash the\n",
      "Philistine and hold forth on unappreciated merit that she could hardly\n",
      "believe the miracle when, in answer to a sympathetic bromide on the\n",
      "popular lack of taste in Art, Beverley replied that, as far as he was\n",
      "concerned, the public showed strong good sense. If he had been striving\n",
      "with every nerve to win her esteem, he could not have done it more\n",
      "surely than with that one remark. Though she invariably listened with a\n",
      "sweet patience which encouraged them to continue long after the point\n",
      "at which she had begun in spirit to throw things at them, Annette had\n",
      "no sympathy with men who whined. She herself was a fighter. She hated\n",
      "as much as anyone the sickening blows which Fate hands out to the\n",
      "struggling and ambitious; but she never made them the basis of a\n",
      "monologue act. Often, after a dreary trip round the offices of the\n",
      "music-publishers, she would howl bitterly in secret, and even gnaw her\n",
      "pillow in the watches of the night; but in public her pride kept her\n",
      "unvaryingly bright and cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, for the first time, she revealed something of her woes. There\n",
      "was that about the mop-headed young man which invited confidences. She\n",
      "told him of the stony-heartedness of music-publishers, of the\n",
      "difficulty of getting songs printed unless you paid for them, of their\n",
      "wretched sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But those songs you've been playing,' said Beverley, 'they've been\n",
      "published?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, those three. But they are the only ones.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And didn't they sell?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hardly at all. You see, a song doesn't sell unless somebody well known\n",
      "sings it. And people promise to sing them, and then don't keep their\n",
      "word. You can't depend on what they say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give me their names,' said Beverley, 'and I'll go round tomorrow and\n",
      "shoot the whole lot. But can't you do anything?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only keep on keeping on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish,' he said, 'that any time you're feeling blue about things you\n",
      "would come up and pour out the poison on me. It's no good bottling it\n",
      "up. Come up and tell me about it, and you'll feel ever so much better.\n",
      "Or let me come down. Any time things aren't going right just knock on\n",
      "the ceiling.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so\n",
      "sensitive as a reformed floor-knocker. You will come up or let me come\n",
      "down, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out\n",
      "and kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only thing\n",
      "for you to do is to knock on the ceiling. Then I'll come charging down\n",
      "and see if there's anything I can do to help.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You'll be sorry you ever said this.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I won't,' he said stoutly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you really mean it, it _would_ be a relief,' she admitted.\n",
      "'Sometimes I'd give all the money I'm ever likely to make for someone\n",
      "to shriek my grievances at. I always think it must have been so nice\n",
      "for the people in the old novels, when they used to say: \"Sit down and\n",
      "I will tell you the story of my life.\" Mustn't it have been heavenly?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well,' said Beverley, rising, 'you know where I am if I'm wanted.\n",
      "Right up there where the knocking came from.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Knocking?' said Annette. 'I remember no knocking.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you mind shaking hands?' said Beverley.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "A particularly maddening hour with one of her pupils drove her up the\n",
      "very next day. Her pupils were at once her salvation and her despair.\n",
      "They gave her the means of supporting life, but they made life hardly\n",
      "worth supporting. Some of them were learning the piano. Others thought\n",
      "they sang. All had solid ivory skulls. There was about a teaspoonful of\n",
      "grey matter distributed among the entire squad, and the pupil Annette\n",
      "had been teaching that afternoon had come in at the tail-end of the\n",
      "division.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the studio with Beverley she found Reginald Sellers, standing in a\n",
      "critical attitude before the easel. She was not very fond of him. He\n",
      "was a long, offensive, patronizing person, with a moustache that looked\n",
      "like a smear of charcoal, and a habit of addressing her as 'Ah, little\n",
      "one!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley looked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you brought your hatchet, Miss Brougham? If you have, you're just\n",
      "in time to join in the massacre of the innocents. Sellers has been\n",
      "smiting my child and cat hip and thigh. Look at his eye. There! Did you\n",
      "see it flash then? He's on the warpath again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My dear Beverley,' said Sellers, rather stiffly, 'I am merely\n",
      "endeavouring to give you my idea of the picture's defects. I am sorry\n",
      "if my criticism has to be a little harsh.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Go right on,' said Beverley, cordially. 'Don't mind me; it's all for\n",
      "my good.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, in a word, then, it is lifeless. Neither the child nor the cat\n",
      "lives.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped back a pace and made a frame of his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The cat now,' he said. 'It is--how shall I put it? It has\n",
      "no--no--er--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That kind of cat wouldn't,' said Beverley. 'It isn't that breed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think it's a dear cat,' said Annette. She felt her temper, always\n",
      "quick, getting the better of her. She knew just how incompetent\n",
      "Sellers was, and it irritated her beyond endurance to see Beverley's\n",
      "good-humoured acceptance of his patronage.\n",
      "\n",
      "'At any rate,' said Beverley, with a grin, 'you both seem to recognize\n",
      "that it is a cat. You're solid on that point, and that's something,\n",
      "seeing I'm only a beginner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know, my dear fellow; I know,' said Sellers, graciously. 'You\n",
      "mustn't let my criticism discourage you. Don't think that your work\n",
      "lacks promise. Far from it. I am sure that in time you will do very\n",
      "well indeed. Quite well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A cold glitter might have been observed in Annette's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Sellers,' she said, smoothly, 'had to work very hard himself before\n",
      "he reached his present position. You know his work, of course?'\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time Beverley seemed somewhat confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I--er--why--' he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, but of course you do,' she went on, sweetly. 'It's in all the\n",
      "magazines.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley looked at the great man with admiration, and saw that he had\n",
      "flushed uncomfortably. He put this down to the modesty of genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "'In the advertisement pages,' said Annette. 'Mr Sellers drew that\n",
      "picture of the Waukeesy Shoe and the Restawhile Settee and the tin of\n",
      "sardines in the Little Gem Sardine advertisement. He is very good at\n",
      "still life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a tense silence. Beverley could almost hear the voice of the\n",
      "referee uttering the count.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Miss Brougham,' said Sellers at last, spitting out the words, 'has\n",
      "confined herself to the purely commercial side of my work. There is\n",
      "another.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, of course there is. You sold a landscape for five pounds only\n",
      "eight months ago, didn't you? And another three months before that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was enough. Sellers bowed stiffly and stalked from the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley picked up a duster and began slowly to sweep the floor with\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you doing?' demanded Annette, in a choking voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The fragments of the wretched man,' whispered Beverley. 'They must be\n",
      "swept up and decently interred. You certainly have got the punch, Miss\n",
      "Brougham.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He dropped the duster with a startled exclamation, for Annette had\n",
      "suddenly burst into a flood of tears. With her face buried in her hands\n",
      "she sat in her chair and sobbed desperately.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a cat! I'm a beast! I hate myself!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a pig! I'm a fiend!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We're all struggling and trying to get on and having hard luck, and\n",
      "instead of doing what I can to help, I go and t-t-taunt him with not\n",
      "being able to sell his pictures! I'm not fit to live! _Oh!_'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of gulping sobs followed, diminishing by degrees into silence.\n",
      "Presently she looked up and smiled, a moist and pathetic smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm sorry,' she said, 'for being so stupid. But he was so horrid and\n",
      "patronizing to you, I couldn't help scratching. I believe I'm the worst\n",
      "cat in London.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, this is,' said Beverley, pointing to the canvas. 'At least,\n",
      "according to the late Sellers. But, I say, tell me, isn't the deceased\n",
      "a great artist, then? He came curveting in here with his chest out and\n",
      "started to slate my masterpiece, so I naturally said, \"What-ho! 'Tis a\n",
      "genius!\" Isn't he?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He can't sell his pictures anywhere. He lives on the little he can get\n",
      "from illustrating advertisements. And I t-taunt--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'_Please!_' said Beverley, apprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "She recovered herself with a gulp.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't help it,' she said, miserably. 'I rubbed it in. Oh, it was\n",
      "hateful of me! But I was all on edge from teaching one of my awful\n",
      "pupils, and when he started to patronize you--'\n",
      "\n",
      "She blinked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Poor devil!' said Beverley. 'I never guessed. Good Lord!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Annette rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I must go and tell him I'm sorry,' she said. 'He'll snub me horribly,\n",
      "but I must.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She went out. Beverley lit a pipe and stood at the window looking\n",
      "thoughtfully down into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people\n",
      "do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of\n",
      "them. Sellers belonged to the latter class. When Annette, meek,\n",
      "penitent, with all her claws sheathed, came to him and grovelled, he\n",
      "forgave her with a repulsive magnanimity which in a less subdued mood\n",
      "would have stung her to renewed pugnacity. As it was, she allowed\n",
      "herself to be forgiven, and retired with a dismal conviction that from\n",
      "now on he would be more insufferable than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her surmise proved absolutely correct. His visits to the newcomer's\n",
      "studio began again, and Beverley's picture, now nearing completion,\n",
      "came in for criticism enough to have filled a volume. The good humour\n",
      "with which he received it amazed Annette. She had no proprietary\n",
      "interest in the painting beyond what she acquired from a growing regard\n",

      "able to speak as one having authority. After years of floundering, his\n",
      "luck seemed at last to have turned. His pictures, which for months had\n",
      "lain at an agent's, careened like crippled battleships, had at length\n",
      "begun to find a market. Within the past two weeks three landscapes and\n",
      "an allegorical painting had sold for good prices; and under the\n",
      "influence of success he expanded like an opening floweret. When\n",
      "Epstein, the agent, wrote to say that the allegory had been purchased\n",
      "by a Glasgow plutocrat of the name of Bates for one hundred and sixty\n",
      "guineas, Sellers' views on Philistines and their crass materialism and\n",
      "lack of taste underwent a marked modification. He spoke with some\n",
      "friendliness of the man Bates.\n",
      "\n",
      "'To me,' said Beverley, when informed of the event by Annette, 'the\n",
      "matter has a deeper significance. It proves that Glasgow has at last\n",
      "produced a sober man. No drinker would have dared face that allegory.\n",
      "The whole business is very gratifying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverley himself was progressing slowly in the field of Art. He had\n",
      "finished the 'Child and Cat', and had taken it to Epstein together with\n",
      "a letter of introduction from Sellers. Sellers' habitual attitude now\n",
      "was that of the kindly celebrity who has arrived and wishes to give the\n",
      "youngsters a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its departure Beverley had not done much in the way of actual\n",
      "execution. Whenever Annette came to his studio he was either sitting in\n",
      "a chair with his feet on the window-sill, smoking, or in the same\n",
      "attitude listening to Sellers' views on art. Sellers being on the\n",
      "upgrade, a man with many pounds to his credit in the bank, had more\n",
      "leisure now. He had given up his advertisement work, and was planning a\n",
      "great canvas--another allegorical work. This left him free to devote a\n",
      "good deal of time to Beverley, and he did so. Beverley sat and smoked\n",
      "through his harangues. He may have been listening, or he may not.\n",
      "Annette listened once or twice, and the experience had the effect of\n",
      "sending her to Beverley, quivering with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why do you _let_ him patronize you like that?' she demanded. 'If\n",
      "anybody came and talked to me like that about my music, I'd--I'd--I\n",
      "don't know what I'd do. Yes, even if he were really a great musician.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'He seems to be able to sell his pictures, so I suppose they must be\n",
      "good; but nothing could give him the right to patronize you as he\n",
      "does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"My learned friend's manner would be intolerable in an emperor to a\n",

      "\n",

      "aren't you running around the square, singing like a bird?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Because,' said Annette, 'unfortunately, I had to pay the expenses of\n",

      "with that yet. If they ever do, perhaps there'll be a new edition.'\n",

      "with a name like Grusczinsky could sell a dozen editions by himself.\n",
      "Helped and inspired by Buchterkirch, he will make the waltz the talk of\n",
      "the country. Infants will croon it in their cots.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He didn't seem to think so when I saw him last.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not. He doesn't know his own power. Grusczinsky's shrinking\n",

      "\n",
      "'I'll give him anything if he'll only sell an edition or two,' said\n",
      "Annette.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outstanding thing was that he did. There seemed no particular\n",
      "reason why the sale of that waltz should not have been as small and as\n",
      "slow as that of any other waltz by an unknown composer. But almost\n",
      "without warning it expanded from a trickle into a flood. Grusczinsky,\n",
      "beaming paternally whenever Annette entered the shop--which was\n",
      "often--announced two new editions in a week. Beverley, his artistic\n",
      "growth still under a watchful eye of Sellers, said he had never had\n",
      "any doubts as to the success of the thing from the moment when a single\n",
      "phrase in it had so carried him away that he had been compelled to stamp\n",
      "his applause enthusiastically on the floor. Even Sellers forgot his own\n",
      "triumphs long enough to allow him to offer affable congratulations. And\n",
      "money came rolling in, smoothing the path of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were great days. There was a hat ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Life, in short, was very full and splendid. There was, indeed, but one\n",
      "thing which kept it from being perfect. The usual drawback to success is\n",
      "that it annoys one's friends so; but in Annette's case this drawback was\n",
      "absent. Sellers' demeanour towards her was that of an old-established\n",
      "inmate welcoming a novice into the Hall of Fame. Her pupils--worthy\n",
      "souls, though bone-headed--fawned upon her. Beverley seemed more pleased\n",
      "than anyone. Yet it was Beverley who prevented her paradise from being\n",
      "complete. Successful herself, she wanted all her friends to be successful;\n",
      "but Beverley, to her discomfort, remained a cheery failure, and worse,\n",
      "absolutely refused to snub Sellers. It was not as if Sellers' advice and\n",
      "comments were disinterested. Beverley was simply the instrument on which\n",
      "he played his songs of triumph. It distressed Annette to such an extent\n",

      "she came down again without knocking.\n",

      "that's arrived. Does he want it forwarded on to him, or what?' The\n",
      "voice was growing high and excited. Evidently Mr Morrison was in a\n",
      "state of nervous tension when a man does not care particularly who\n",
      "hears his troubles so long as he unburdens himself of them to someone.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Music!' shrilled Mr Morrison. 'Stacks and stacks and stacks of it. Is\n",
      "he playing a practical joke on me, or what?' he demanded, hysterically.\n",
      "Plainly he had now come to regard Annette as a legitimate confidante.\n",
      "She was listening. That was the main point. He wanted someone--he did\n",
      "not care whom--who would listen. 'He lends me his rooms,' wailed Mr\n",
      "Morrison, 'so that I can be perfectly quiet and undisturbed while I\n",
      "write my novel, and, first thing I know, this music starts to arrive.\n",

      "high with great parcels of music, and more coming every day?'\n",

      "little sitting-room looking out on the garden was not packed. It is\n",
      "true that the conversation lacked some of the sparkle generally found\n",
      "in the better class of _salon_. To be absolutely accurate, there\n",

      "But they did not shine at small-talk. Conversationally they were a\n",
      "spent force after they had asked Mr Williams how his rheumatism was.\n",
      "Thereafter they contented themselves with sitting massively about in\n",
      "corners, glowering at each other. Still, it was all very jolly and\n",
      "sociable, and helped to pass the long evenings. And, as Mrs Williams\n",
      "pointed out, in reply to some rather strong remarks from Mr Williams on\n",

      "in that house, with young bloods like Ted Pringle, Albert Parsons,\n",
      "Arthur Brown, and Joe Blossom (to name four of the most assiduous)\n",
      "exercising their fascinations at close range, he did not like to\n",
      "think. Again and again he strove to brace himself up to join the feasts\n",
      "of reason and flows of soul which he knew were taking place nightly\n",
      "around the object of his devotions, but every time he failed. Habit is\n",
      "a terrible thing; it shackles the strongest, and Tom had fallen into\n",
      "the habit of inquiring after Mr Williams' rheumatism over the garden\n",
      "fence first thing in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a civil, neighbourly thing to do, but it annihilated the only\n",
      "excuse he could think of for looking in at night. He could not help\n",
      "himself. It was like some frightful scourge--the morphine habit, or\n",
      "something of that sort. Every morning he swore to himself that nothing\n",
      "would induce him to mention the subject of rheumatism, but no sooner\n",
      "had the stricken old gentleman's head appeared above the fence than\n",
      "out it came.\n",

      "\n",
      "And there he was, with his guns spiked.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he did not give up. He brought to his wooing the same\n",
      "determination which had made him second gardener at the Hall at\n",
      "twenty-five. He was a novice at the game, but instinct told him that a\n",
      "good line of action was to shower gifts. He did so. All he had to shower\n",
      "was vegetables, and he showered them in a way that would have caused the\n",
      "goddess Ceres to be talked about. His garden became a perfect crater,\n",
      "erupting vegetables. Why vegetables? I think I hear some heckler cry.\n",
      "Why not flowers--fresh, fair, fragrant flowers? You can do a lot with\n",
      "flowers. Girls love them. There is poetry in them. And, what is more,\n",
      "there is a recognized language of flowers. Shoot in a rose, or a\n",
      "calceolaria, or an herbaceous border, or something, I gather, and you\n",
      "have made a formal proposal of marriage without any of the trouble of\n",
      "rehearsing a long speech and practising appropriate gestures in front\n",
      "of your bedroom looking-glass. Why, then, did not Thomas Kitchener give\n",
      "Sally Preston flowers? Well, you see, unfortunately, it was now late\n",
      "autumn, and there were no flowers. Nature had temporarily exhausted her\n",
      "floral blessings, and was jogging along with potatoes and artichokes\n",
      "and things. Love is like that. It invariably comes just at the wrong\n",
      "time. A few months before there had been enough roses in Tom\n",
      "Kitchener's garden to win the hearts of a dozen girls. Now there were\n",
      "only vegetables, 'Twas ever thus.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to be expected that a devotion so practically displayed\n",
      "should escape comment. This was supplied by that shrewd observer, old\n",
      "Mr Williams. He spoke seriously to Tom across the fence on the subject\n",
      "of his passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Young Tom,' he said, 'drop it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom muttered unintelligibly. Mr Williams adjusted the top-hat without\n",
      "which he never stirred abroad, even into his garden. He blinked\n",
      "benevolently at Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're making up to that young gal of Jane's,' he proceeded. 'You\n",
      "can't deceive _me_. All these p'taties, and what not. _I_ seen\n",
      "your game fast enough. Just you drop it, young Tom.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why?' muttered Tom, rebelliously. A sudden distaste for old Mr\n",
      "Williams blazed within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why? 'Cos you'll only burn your fingers if you don't, that's why. I\n",
      "been watching this young gal of Jane's, and I seen what sort of a young\n",
      "gal she be. She's a flipperty piece, that's what she be. You marry that\n",
      "young gal, Tom, and you'll never have no more quiet and happiness.\n",
      "She'd just take and turn the place upsy-down on you. The man as marries\n",
      "that young gal has got to be master in his own home. He's got to show\n",
      "her what's what. Now, you ain't got the devil in you to do that, Tom.\n",
      "You're what I might call a sort of a sheep. I admires it in you, Tom. I\n",
      "like to see a young man steady and quiet, same as what you be. So\n",
      "that's how it is, you see. Just you drop this foolishness, young Tom,\n",
      "and leave that young gal be, else you'll burn your fingers, same as\n",
      "what I say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And, giving his top-hat a rakish tilt, the old gentleman ambled\n",
      "indoors, satisfied that he had dropped a guarded hint in a pleasant and\n",
      "tactful manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be supposed that this interview stung Tom to swift action.\n",
      "Otherwise, one cannot explain why he should not have been just as\n",
      "reticent on the subject nearest his heart when bestowing on Sally the\n",
      "twenty-seventh cabbage as he had been when administering the hundred\n",
      "and sixtieth potato. At any rate, the fact remains that, as that\n",
      "fateful vegetable changed hands across the fence, something resembling\n",
      "a proposal of marriage did actually proceed from him. As a sustained\n",
      "piece of emotional prose it fell short of the highest standard. Most of\n",
      "it was lost at the back of his throat, and what did emerge was mainly\n",
      "inaudible. However, as she distinctly caught the word 'love' twice, and\n",
      "as Tom was shuffling his feet and streaming with perspiration, and\n",
      "looking everywhere at once except at her, Sally grasped the situation.\n",
      "Whereupon, without any visible emotion, she accepted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had to ask her to repeat her remark. He could not believe his\n",
      "luck. It is singular how diffident a normally self-confident man can\n",
      "become, once he is in love. When Colonel Milvery, of the Hall, had\n",
      "informed him of his promotion to the post of second gardener, Tom had\n",
      "demanded no _encore_. He knew his worth. He was perfectly aware\n",
      "that he was a good gardener, and official recognition of the fact left\n",
      "him gratified, but unperturbed. But this affair of Sally was quite\n",
      "another matter. It had revolutionized his standards of value--forced\n",
      "him to consider himself as a man, entirely apart from his skill as a\n",
      "gardener. And until this moment he had had grave doubt as to whether,\n",
      "apart from his skill as a gardener, he amounted to much.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was overwhelmed. He kissed Sally across the fence humbly. Sally, for\n",
      "her part, seemed very unconcerned about it all. A more critical man\n",
      "than Thomas Kitchener might have said that, to all appearances, the\n",
      "thing rather bored Sally.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't tell anybody just yet,' she stipulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom would have given much to be allowed to announce his triumph\n",
      "defiantly to old Mr Williams, to say nothing of making a considerable\n",
      "noise about it in the village; but her wish was law, and he reluctantly\n",
      "agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "There are moments in a man's life when, however enthusiastic a\n",
      "gardener he may be, his soul soars above vegetables. Tom's shot with a\n",
      "jerk into the animal kingdom. The first present he gave Sally in his\n",
      "capacity of fiance was a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a half-grown puppy with long legs and a long tail, belonging\n",
      "to no one species, but generously distributing itself among about six.\n",
      "Sally loved it, and took it with her wherever she went. And on one of\n",
      "these rambles down swooped Constable Cobb, the village policeman,\n",
      "pointing out that, contrary to regulations, the puppy had no collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible that a judicious meekness on Sally's part might have\n",
      "averted disaster. Mr Cobb was human, and Sally was looking\n",
      "particularly attractive that morning. Meekness, however, did not come\n",
      "easily to Sally. In a speech which began as argument and ended (Mr\n",
      "Cobb proving solid and unyielding) as pure cheek, she utterly routed\n",
      "the constable. But her victory was only a moral one, for as she turned\n",
      "to go Mr Cobb, dull red and puffing slightly, was already entering\n",
      "particulars of the affair in his note-book, and Sally knew that the\n",
      "last word was with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her way back she met Tom Kitchener. He was looking very tough and\n",
      "strong, and at the sight of him a half-formed idea, which she had\n",
      "regretfully dismissed as impracticable, of assaulting Constable Cobb,\n",
      "returned to her in an amended form. Tom did not know it, but the\n",
      "reason why she smiled so radiantly upon him at that moment was that she\n",
      "had just elected him to the post of hired assassin. While she did not\n",
      "want Constable Cobb actually assassinated, she earnestly desired him\n",
      "to have his helmet smashed down over his eyes; and it seemed to her\n",
      "that Tom was the man to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She poured out her grievance to him and suggested her scheme. She even\n",
      "elaborated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why shouldn't you wait for him one night and throw him into the creek?\n",
      "It isn't deep, and it's jolly muddy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Um!' said Tom, doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It would just teach him,' she pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prospect of undertaking the higher education of the police did\n",
      "not seem to appeal to Tom. In his heart he rather sympathized with\n",
      "Constable Cobb. He saw the policeman's point of view. It is all very\n",
      "well to talk, but when you are stationed in a sleepy village where no\n",
      "one ever murders, or robs, or commits arson, or even gets drunk and\n",
      "disorderly in the street, a puppy without a collar is simply a godsend.\n",
      "A man must look out for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to make this side of the question clear to Sally, but failed\n",
      "signally. She took a deplorable view of his attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I might have known you'd have been afraid,' she said, with a\n",
      "contemptuous jerk of her chin. 'Good morning.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom flushed. He knew he had never been afraid of anything in his life,\n",
      "except her; but nevertheless the accusation stung. And as he was still\n",
      "afraid of her he stammered as he began to deny the charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, leave off!' said Sally, irritably. 'Suck a lozenge.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm not afraid,' said Tom, condensing his remarks to their minimum as\n",
      "his only chance of being intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm not. It's just that I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "A nasty gleam came into Sally's eyes. Her manner was haughty.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It doesn't matter.' She paused. 'I've no doubt Ted Pringle will do\n",
      "what I want.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For all her contempt, she could not keep a touch of uneasiness from her\n",
      "eyes as she prepared to make her next remark. There was a look about\n",
      "Tom's set jaw which made her hesitate. But her temper had run away with\n",
      "her, and she went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am sure he will,' she said. 'When we became engaged he said that he\n",
      "would do anything for me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some speeches that are such conversational knockout blows\n",
      "that one can hardly believe that life will ever pick itself up and go\n",
      "on again after them. Yet it does. The dramatist brings down the\n",
      "curtain on such speeches. The novelist blocks his reader's path with a\n",
      "zareba of stars. But in life there are no curtains, no stars, nothing\n",
      "final and definite--only ragged pauses and discomfort. There was such\n",
      "a pause now.\n",

      "happened to Tom. He, too, had changed, but how she did not know. Yet\n",

      "\n",

      "into a lane, and through a gate into a field. They passed into a second\n",
      "field, and as they did so Sally's heart gave a leap. Ted Pringle was\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ted Pringle was a big young man, bigger even than Tom Kitchener, and,\n",
      "like Tom, he was of silent habit. He eyed the little procession\n",
      "inquiringly, but spoke no word. There was a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ted,' said Tom, 'there's been a mistake.'\n",

      "\n",
      "I cannot help feeling a little sorry for Ted Pringle. In the light of\n",
      "what happened, I could wish that it were possible to portray him as a\n",
      "hulking brute of evil appearance and worse morals--the sort of person\n",
      "concerning whom one could reflect comfortably that he deserved all he\n",
      "got. I should like to make him an unsympathetic character, over whose\n",
      "downfall the reader would gloat. But honesty compels me to own that Ted\n",
      "was a thoroughly decent young man in every way. He was a good citizen,\n",
      "a dutiful son, and would certainly have made an excellent husband.\n",
      "Furthermore, in the dispute on hand he had right on his side fully as\n",
      "much as Tom. The whole affair was one of those elemental clashings of\n",
      "man and man where the historian cannot sympathize with either side at\n",
      "the expense of the other, but must confine himself to a mere statement\n",
      "of what occurred. And, briefly, what occurred was that Tom, bringing to\n",
      "the fray a pent-up fury which his adversary had had no time to\n",
      "generate, fought Ted to a complete standstill in the space of two\n",
      "minutes and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sally had watched the proceedings, sick and horrified. She had never\n",
      "seen men fight before, and the terror of it overwhelmed her. Her\n",
      "vanity received no pleasant stimulation from the thought that it was\n",
      "for her sake that this storm had been let loose. For the moment her\n",
      "vanity was dead, stunned by collision with the realities. She found\n",
      "herself watching in a dream. She saw Ted fall, rise, fall again, and\n",
      "lie where he had fallen; and then she was aware that Tom was speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come along!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She hung back. Ted was lying very still. Gruesome ideas presented\n",
      "themselves. She had just accepted them as truth when Ted wriggled. He\n",
      "wriggled again. Then he sat up suddenly, looked at her with unseeing\n",
      "eyes, and said something in a thick voice. She gave a little sob of\n",
      "relief. It was ghastly, but not so ghastly as what she had been\n",
      "imagining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody touched her arm. Tom was by her side, grim and formidable. He\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The uglinesses of life, as we grow accustomed to them, lose their power\n",
      "to shock, and there is no doubt that Sally looked with a different eye\n",
      "upon this second struggle. She was conscious of a thrill of\n",
      "excitement, very different from the shrinking horror which had seized\n",
      "her before. Her stunned vanity began to tingle into life again. The\n",
      "fight was raging furiously over the trampled turf, and quite suddenly,\n",
      "as she watched, she was aware that her heart was with Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no longer two strange brutes fighting in a field. It was her man\n",
      "battling for her sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "She desired overwhelmingly that he should win, that he should not be\n",
      "hurt, that he should sweep triumphantly over Albert Parsons as he had\n",
      "swept over Ted Pringle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it was evident, even to her, that he was being hurt, and\n",
      "that he was very far from sweeping triumphantly over Albert Parsons. He\n",
      "had not allowed himself time to recover from his first battle, and his\n",
      "blows were slow and weary. Albert, moreover, was made of sterner stuff\n",
      "than Ted. Though now a peaceful tender of cows, there had been a time\n",
      "in his hot youth when, travelling with a circus, he had fought, week\n",
      "in, week out, relays of just such rustic warriors as Tom. He knew their\n",
      "methods--their headlong rushes, their swinging blows. They were the\n",
      "merest commonplaces of life to him. He slipped Tom, he side-stepped\n",
      "Tom, he jabbed Tom; he did everything to Tom that a trained boxer can\n",
      "do to a reckless novice, except knock the fight out of him, until\n",
      "presently, through the sheer labour of hitting, he, too, grew weary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the days when Albert Parsons had fought whole families of Toms\n",
      "in an evening, he had fought in rounds, with the boss holding the\n",
      "watch, and half-minute rests, and water to refresh him, and all orderly\n",
      "and proper. Today there were no rounds, no rests, no water, and the\n",
      "peaceful tending of cows had caused flesh to grow where there had been\n",
      "only muscle. Tom's headlong rushes became less easy to side-step, his\n",
      "swinging blows more difficult than the scientific counter that shot out\n",
      "to check them. As he tired Tom seemed to regain strength. The tide of\n",
      "the battle began to ebb. He clinched, and Tom threw him off. He\n",
      "feinted, and while he was feinting Tom was on him. It was the climax of\n",
      "the battle--the last rally. Down went Albert, and stayed down.\n",
      "Physically, he was not finished; but in his mind a question had framed\n",
      "itself--the question. 'Was it worth it?'--and he was answering, 'No.'\n",
      "There were other girls in the world. No girl was worth all this\n",

      "spectacle, but Sally was past the weaker emotions. She was back in the\n",
      "Stone Age, and her only feeling was one of passionate pride. She tried\n",
      "to speak. She struggled to put all she felt into words, but something\n",

      "ear said, 'Keep still; don't struggle. There's no danger.'\n",
      "\n",
      "George did not struggle. His brain, working with the cool rapidity of a\n",
      "buzz-saw in an ice-box, had planned a line of action. Few things are\n",
      "more difficult in this world for a young man than the securing of an\n",
      "introduction to the right girl under just the right conditions. When he\n",
      "is looking his best he is presented to her in the midst of a crowd, and\n",
      "is swept away after a rapid hand-shake. When there is no crowd he has\n",
      "toothache, or the sun has just begun to make his nose peel. Thousands\n",
      "of young lives have been saddened in this manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "How different was George's case! By this simple accident, he reflected,\n",
      "as, helping the good work along with an occasional surreptitious\n",
      "leg-stroke, he was towed shorewards, there had been formed an\n",
      "acquaintanceship, if nothing more, which could not lightly be broken. A\n",
      "girl who has saved a man from drowning cannot pass him by next day with\n",
      "a formal bow. And what a girl, too! There had been a time, in extreme\n",
      "youth, when his feminine ideal was the sort of girl who has fuzzy,\n",
      "golden hair, and drops things. Indeed in his first year at the\n",
      "University he had said--and written--as much to one of the type, the\n",
      "episode concluding with a strong little drama, in which a wrathful,\n",
      "cheque-signing father had starred, supported by a subdued, misogynistic\n",
      "son. Which things, aided by the march of time, had turned George's\n",
      "tastes towards the healthy, open-air girl, who did things instead of\n",
      "dropping them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pleasantest functions must come to an end sooner or later; and in\n",
      "due season George felt his heels grate on the sand. His preserver\n",
      "loosed her hold. They stood up and faced each other. George began to\n",
      "express his gratitude as best he could--it was not easy to find neat,\n",
      "convincing sentences on the spur of the moment--but she cut him short.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course, it was nothing. Nothing at all,' she said, brushing the\n",
      "sea-water from her eyes. 'It was just lucky I happened to be there.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was splendid,' said the infatuated dramatist. 'It was magnificent.\n",
      "It--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw that she was smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're very wet,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "George glanced down at his soaked clothes. It had been a nice suit\n",
      "once.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hadn't you better hurry back and change into something dry?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking round about him, George perceived that sundry of the\n",
      "inquisitive were swooping down, with speculation in their eyes. It was\n",
      "time to depart.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you far to go?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not far. I'm staying at the Beach View Hotel.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, so am I. I hope we shall meet again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We shall,' said George confidently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How did you happen to fall in?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was--er--I was looking at something in the water.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you were,' said the girl, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "George blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know,' he said, 'it was abominably rude of me to stare like that;\n",
      "but--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You should learn to swim,' interrupted the girl. 'I can't understand\n",
      "why every boy in the country isn't made to learn to swim before he's\n",
      "ten years old. And it isn't a bit difficult, really. I could teach you\n",
      "in a week.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The struggle between George and George's conscience was brief. The\n",
      "conscience, weak by nature and flabby from long want of exercise, had\n",
      "no sort of chance from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish you would,' said George. And with those words he realized that\n",
      "he had definitely committed himself to his hypocritical role. Till\n",
      "that moment explanation would have been difficult, but possible. Now it\n",
      "was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will,' said the girl. 'I'll start tomorrow if you like.' She waded\n",
      "into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We'll talk it over at the hotel,' she said, hastily. 'Here comes a\n",
      "crowd of horrid people. I'm going to swim out again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She hurried into deeper water, while George, turning, made his way\n",
      "through a growing throng of goggling spectators. Of the fifteen who got\n",
      "within speaking distance of him, six told him that he was wet. The\n",
      "other nine asked him if he had fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Her name was Vaughan, and she was visiting Marvis Bay in company with\n",
      "an aunt. So much George ascertained from the management of the hotel.\n",
      "Later, after dinner, meeting both ladies on the esplanade, he gleaned\n",
      "further information--to wit, that her first name was Mary, that her\n",
      "aunt was glad to make his acquaintance, liked Marvis Bay but preferred\n",
      "Trouville, and thought it was getting a little chilly and would go\n",
      "indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elimination of the third factor had a restorative effect upon\n",
      "George's conversation, which had begun to languish. In feminine society\n",
      "as a rule he was apt to be constrained, but with Mary Vaughan it was\n",
      "different. Within a couple of minutes he was pouring out his troubles.\n",
      "The cue-withholding leading lady, the stick-like Mifflin, the funereal\n",
      "comedian--up they all came, and she, gently sympathetic, was\n",
      "endeavouring, not without success, to prove to him that things were not\n",
      "so bad as they seemed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's sure to be all right on the night,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "How rare is the combination of beauty and intelligence! George thought\n",
      "he had never heard such a clear-headed, well-expressed remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I suppose it will,' he said, 'but they were very bad when I left.\n",
      "Mifflin, for instance. He seems to think Nature intended him for a\n",
      "Napoleon of Advertising. He has a bee in his bonnet about booming the\n",
      "piece. Sits up at nights, when he ought to be sleeping or studying his\n",
      "part, thinking out new schemes for advertising the show. And the\n",
      "comedian. His speciality is drawing me aside and asking me to write in\n",
      "new scenes for him. I couldn't stand it any longer. I just came away\n",
      "and left them to fight it out among themselves.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm sure you have no need to worry. A play with such a good story is\n",
      "certain to succeed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "George had previously obliged with a brief description of the plot of\n",
      "_The Footpills_.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you like the story?' he said, tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought it was fine.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How sympathetic you are!' cooed George, glutinously, edging a little\n",
      "closer. 'Do you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Shall we be going back to the hotel?' said the girl.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Those noisome creatures, the hired murderers of _Fate's Footpills_,\n",
      "descended upon Marvis Bay early next afternoon, and George, meeting\n",
      "them at the station, in reluctant pursuance of a promise given to\n",
      "Arthur Mifflin, felt moodily that, if only they could make their\n",
      "acting one-half as full of colour as their clothes, the play would be\n",
      "one of the most pronounced successes of modern times. In the forefront\n",
      "gleamed, like the white plumes of Navarre, the light flannel suit of\n",
      "Arthur Mifflin, the woodenest juvenile in captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "His woodenness was, however, confined to stage rehearsals. It may be\n",
      "mentioned that, once the run of a piece had begun, he was sufficiently\n",
      "volatile, and in private life he was almost excessively so--a fact\n",
      "which had been noted at an early date by the keen-eyed authorities of\n",
      "his University, the discovery leading to his tearing himself away from\n",
      "Alma Mater by request with some suddenness. He was a long, slender\n",
      "youth, with green eyes, jet-black hair, and a passionate fondness for\n",
      "the sound of his own voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, here we are,' he said, kicking breezily at George's leg with his\n",
      "cane.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I saw you,' said George, coldly, side-stepping.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The whole team,' continued Mr Mifflin; 'all bright, bonny, and trained\n",
      "to the minute.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What happened after I left?' George asked. 'Has anybody begun to act\n",
      "yet? Or are they waiting till the dress-rehearsal?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The rehearsals,' admitted Mr Mifflin, handsomely, 'weren't perfect;\n",
      "but you wait. It'll be all right on the night.'\n",
      "\n",
      "George thought he had never heard such a futile, vapid remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Besides,' said Mr Mifflin, 'I have an idea which will make the show.\n",
      "Lend me your ear--both ears. You shall have them back. Tell me: what\n",
      "pulls people into a theatre? A good play? Sometimes. But failing that,\n",
      "as in the present case, what? Fine acting by the leading juvenile? We\n",
      "have that, but it is not enough. No, my boy; advertisement is the\n",
      "thing. Look at all these men on the beach. Are they going to roll in of\n",
      "their own free wills to see a play like _The Footpills_? Not on\n",
      "your life. About the time the curtain rises every man of them will be\n",
      "sitting in his own private corner of the beach--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many corners do you think the beach has?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Gazing into a girl's eyes, singing, \"Shine on, thou harvest moon\", and\n",
      "telling her how his boss is practically dependent on his advice. You\n",
      "know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't,' said George, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Unless,' proceeded Mr Mifflin, 'we advertise. And by advertise, I\n",
      "mean advertise in the right way. We have a Press-agent, but for all the\n",
      "good he does he might be back on the old farm, gathering in the hay.\n",
      "Luckily for us, I am among those present. I have brains, I have\n",
      "resource. What's that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I said nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you did. Well, I have an idea which will drag these people\n",
      "like a magnet. I thought it out coming down in the train.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll tell you later. There are a few details to be worked upon first.\n",
      "Meanwhile, let us trickle to the sea-front and take a sail in one of\n",
      "those boats. I am at my best in a boat. I rather fancy Nature intended\n",
      "me for a Viking.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Matters having been arranged with the financier to whom the boat\n",
      "belonged, they set forth. Mr Mifflin, having remarked, 'Yo-ho!' in a\n",
      "meditative voice, seated himself at the helm, somewhat saddened by his\n",
      "failure to borrow a quid of tobacco from the _Ocean Beauty's_\n",
      "proprietor. For, as he justly observed, without properties and make-up,\n",
      "where were you? George, being skilled in the ways of boats, was in\n",
      "charge of the sheet. The summer day had lost its oppressive heat. The\n",
      "sun no longer beat down on the face of the waters. A fresh breeze had\n",
      "sprung up. George, manipulating the sheet automatically, fell into a\n",
      "reverie. A moment comes in the life of every man when an inward voice\n",
      "whispers to him, 'This is The One!' In George's case the voice had not\n",
      "whispered; it had shouted. From now onward there could be but one woman\n",
      "in the world for him. From now onwards--The _Ocean Beauty_ gave a\n",
      "sudden plunge. George woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What the deuce are you doing with that tiller?' he inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My gentle somnambulist,' said Mr Mifflin, aggrieved, 'I was doing\n",
      "nothing with this tiller. We will now form a commission to inquire into\n",
      "what you were doing with that sheet. Were you asleep?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My fault,' said George; 'I was thinking.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you must break the habit of a lifetime,' said Mr Mifflin,\n",
      "complainingly, 'I wish you would wait till we get ashore. You nearly\n",
      "upset us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It shan't happen again. They are tricky, these sailing boats--turn\n",
      "over in a second. Whatever you do, don't get her broadside on. There's\n",
      "more breeze out here than I thought there was.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Mifflin uttered a startled exclamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's the matter?' asked George.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Just like a flash,' said Mr Mifflin, complacently. 'It's always the\n",
      "way with me. Give me time, and the artistic idea is bound to come. Just\n",
      "some little thought, some little, apparently obvious, idea which stamps\n",
      "the man of genius. It beats me why I didn't think of it before. Why, of\n",
      "course, a costume piece with a male star is a hundred times more\n",
      "effective.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you talking about?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I see now,' continued Mr Mifflin, 'that there was a flaw in my\n",
      "original plan. My idea was this. We were talking in the train about\n",
      "the bathing down here, and Jane happened to say she could swim some,\n",
      "and it suddenly came to me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was the leading woman, she who omitted to give cues.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I said to myself, \"George is a sportsman. He will be delighted to do\n",
      "a little thing like that\".'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Like to do what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, rescue Jane.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She and you,' said Mr Mifflin, 'were to go in swimming together,\n",
      "while I waited on the sands, holding our bone-headed Press-agent on a\n",
      "leash. About a hundred yards from the shore up go her arms. Piercing\n",
      "scream. Agitated crowds on the beach. What is the matter? What has\n",
      "happened? A touch of cramp. Will she be drowned? No! G. Barnert\n",
      "Callender, author of _Fate's Footballs_, which opens at the Beach\n",
      "Theatre on Monday evening next, at eight-fifteen sharp, will save her.\n",
      "See! He has her. He is bringing her in. She is safe. How pleased her\n",
      "mother will be! And the public, what a bit of luck for them! They will\n",
      "be able to see her act at eight-fifteen sharp on Monday after all. Back\n",
      "you come to the shore. Cheering crowds. Weeping women. Strong\n",
      "situation. I unleash the Press-agent, and off he shoots, in time to get\n",
      "the story into the evening paper. It was a great idea, but I see now\n",
      "there were one or two flaws in it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You do, do you?' said George.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It occurs to me on reflection that after all you wouldn't have agreed\n",
      "to it. A something, I don't know what, which is lacking in your nature,\n",
      "would have made you reject the scheme.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm glad that occurred to you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And a far greater flaw was that it was too altruistic. It boomed you\n",
      "and it boomed Jane, but I didn't get a thing out of it. My revised\n",
      "scheme is a thousand times better in every way.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't say you have another.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have. And,' added Mr Mifflin, with modest pride, 'it is a winner.\n",
      "This time I unhesitatingly assert that I have the goods. In about one\n",
      "minute from now you will hear me exclaim, in a clear musical voice, the\n",
      "single word, \"Jump!\" That is your cue to leap over the side as quick as\n",
      "you can move, for at that precise moment this spanking craft is going\n",
      "to capsize.'\n",
      "\n",
      "George spun round in his seat. Mr Mifflin's face was shining with\n",
      "kindly enthusiasm. The shore was at least two hundred yards away, and\n",
      "that morning he had had his first swimming-lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A movement of the tiller will do it. These accidents are common\n",
      "objects of the seashore. I may mention that I can swim just enough to\n",
      "keep myself afloat; so it's up to you. I wouldn't do this for everyone,\n",
      "but, seeing that we were boys together--Are you ready?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stop!' cried George. 'Don't do it! Listen!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you ready?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Ocean Beauty_ gave a plunge.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You lunatic! Listen to me. It--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Jump!' said Mr Mifflin.\n",
      "\n",
      "George came to the surface some yards from the overturned boat, and,\n",
      "looking round for Mr Mifflin, discovered that great thinker treading\n",
      "water a few feet away.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Get to work, George,' he remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not easy to shake one's fist at a man when in deep water, but\n",
      "George managed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'For twopence,' he cried, 'I'd leave you to look after yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can do better than that,' said Mr Mifflin. 'I'll give you\n",
      "threepence to tow me in. Hurry up. It's cold.'\n",
      "\n",
      "In gloomy silence George gripped him by the elbows. Mr Mifflin looked\n",
      "over his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We shall have a good house,' he said. 'The stalls are full already,\n",
      "and the dress-circle's filling. Work away, George, you're doing fine.\n",
      "This act is going to be a scream from start to finish.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With pleasant conversation he endeavoured to while away the monotony of\n",
      "the journey; but George made no reply. He was doing some rapid\n",
      "thinking. With ordinary luck, he felt bitterly, all would have been\n",
      "well. He could have gone on splashing vigorously under his teacher's\n",
      "care for a week, gradually improving till he emerged into a reasonably\n",
      "proficient swimmer. But now! In an age of miracles he might have\n",
      "explained away his present performance; but how was he to--And then\n",
      "there came to him an idea--simple, as all great ideas are, but\n",
      "magnificent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped and trod water.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tired?' said Mr Mifflin. 'Well, take a rest,' he added, kindly, 'take\n",
      "a rest. No need to hurry.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look here,' said George, 'this piece is going to be recast. We're\n",
      "going to exchange parts. You're rescuing me. See? Never mind why. I\n",
      "haven't time to explain it to you now. Do you understand?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said Mr Mifflin.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll get behind you and push you; but don't forget, when we get to the\n",
      "shore, that you've done the rescuing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Mifflin pondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is this wise?' he said. 'It is a strong part, the rescuer, but I'm not\n",
      "sure the other wouldn't suit my style better. The silent hand-grip, the\n",
      "catch in the voice. You want a practised actor for that. I don't think\n",
      "you'd be up to it, George.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Never mind about me. That's how it's going to be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Mifflin pondered once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' he said at length, 'it wouldn't do. You mean well, George, but it\n",
      "would kill the show. We'll go on as before.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Will we?' said George, unpleasantly. 'Would you like to know what I'm\n",
      "going to do to you, then? I'm going to hit you very hard under the jaw,\n",
      "and I'm going to take hold of your neck and squeeze it till you lose\n",
      "consciousness, and then I'm going to drag you to the beach and tell\n",
      "people I had to hit you because you lost your head and struggled.'\n",
      "\n",

      "warmly as to whether he is most like Bayard, Lancelot, or Happy\n",
      "Hooligan. Some say one, some the other. It seems that yesterday you\n",
      "saved him from a watery grave without giving him time to explain that\n",

      "'It isn't so much that you talk to them as that you seem to like--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped. Maud's dignity had melted completely. Her face was buried\n",
      "in her arms. She did not care if a million customers came in, all at\n",
      "the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Maud!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him moving towards her, but she did not look up. The next\n",
      "moment his arms were round her, and he was babbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a customer, pushing open the door unnoticed two minutes later,\n",
      "retired hurriedly to get shaved elsewhere, doubting whether Arthur's\n",
      "mind was on his job.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time this little thunderstorm undoubtedly cleared the air. For a\n",
      "day or two Maud was happier than she ever remembered to have been.\n",
      "Arthur's behaviour was unexceptionable. He bought her a wrist-watch--\n",
      "light brown leather, very smart. He gave her some chocolates to eat in\n",
      "the Tube. He entertained her with amazing statistics, culled from the\n",
      "weekly paper which he bought on Tuesdays. He was, in short, the perfect\n",
      "lover. On the second day the red-faced man came in again. Arthur joined\n",
      "in the laughter at his stories. Everything seemed ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could not last. Gradually things slipped back into the old routine.\n",
      "Maud, looking up from her work, would see the frown and the bitten lip.\n",
      "She began again to feel uncomfortable and self-conscious as she worked.\n",
      "Sometimes their conversation on the way to the Tube was almost formal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was useless to say anything. She had a wholesome horror of being one\n",
      "of those women who nagged; and she felt that to complain again would\n",
      "amount to nagging. She tried to put the thing out of her mind, but it\n",
      "insisted on staying there. In a way she understood his feelings. He\n",
      "loved her so much, she supposed, that he hated the idea of her\n",
      "exchanging a single word with another man. This, in the abstract, was\n",
      "gratifying; but in practice it distressed her. She wished she were some\n",
      "sort of foreigner, so that nobody could talk to her. But then they\n",
      "would look at her, and that probably would produce much the same\n",
      "results. It was a hard world for a girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the strange thing happened. Arthur reformed. One might almost\n",
      "say that he reformed with a jerk. It was a parallel case to those\n",
      "sudden conversions at Welsh revival meetings. On Monday evening he had\n",
      "been at his worst. On the following morning he was a changed man. Not\n",
      "even after the original thunderstorm had he been more docile. Maud\n",
      "could not believe that first. The lip, once bitten, was stretched in a\n",
      "smile. She looked for the frown. It was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day it was the same; and the day after that. When a week had gone\n",
      "by, and still the improvement was maintained, Maud felt that she might\n",
      "now look upon it as permanent. A great load seemed to have been taken\n",
      "off her mind. She revised her views on the world. It was a very good\n",
      "world, quite one of the best, with Arthur beaming upon it like a sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of eminent poets and essayists, in the course of the last few\n",
      "centuries, have recorded, in their several ways, their opinion that one\n",
      "can have too much of a good thing. The truth applies even to such a\n",
      "good thing as absence of jealousy. Little by little Maud began to grow\n",
      "uneasy. It began to come home to her that she preferred the old Arthur,\n",
      "of the scowl and the gnawed lip. Of him she had at least been sure.\n",
      "Whatever discomfort she may have suffered from his spirited imitations\n",
      "of Othello, at any rate they had proved that he loved her. She would\n",
      "have accepted gladly an equal amount of discomfort now in exchange for\n",
      "the same certainty. She could not read this new Arthur. His thoughts\n",
      "were a closed book. Superficially, he was all that she could have\n",
      "wished. He still continued to escort her to the Tube, to buy her\n",
      "occasional presents, to tap, when conversing, the pleasantly\n",
      "sentimental vein. But now these things were not enough. Her heart was\n",
      "troubled. Her thoughts frightened her. The little black imp at the back\n",
      "of her mind kept whispering and whispering, till at last she was forced\n",

      "light-hearted abandon on the Wiggle-Woggle had been noted and commented\n",
      "upon by several lookers-on. Confronted with the Hairy Ainus, he had\n",
      "touched a high level of facetiousness. And now, as he sat with her\n",
      "listening to the band, he was crooning joyously to himself in\n",
      "accompaniment to the music, without, it would appear, a care in the\n",
      "world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud was hurt and anxious. In a mere acquaintance this blithe attitude\n",
      "would have been welcome. It would have helped her to enjoy her evening.\n",
      "But from Arthur at that particular moment she looked for something\n",
      "else. Why was he cheerful? Only a few hours ago she had been--yes,\n",
      "flirting with another man before his very eyes. What right had he to be\n",
      "cheerful? He ought to be heated, full of passionate demands for an\n",
      "explanation--a flushed, throaty thing to be coaxed back into a good\n",
      "temper and then forgiven--all this at great length--for having been in\n",
      "a bad one. Yes, she told herself, she had wanted certainty one way or\n",
      "the other, and here it was. Now she knew. He no longer cared for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cold?' said Arthur. 'Let's walk. Evenings beginning to draw in now.\n",
      "Lum-da-diddley-ah. That's what I call a good tune. Give me something\n",
      "lively and bright. Dumty-umpty-iddley-ah. Dum tum--'\n",

      "\n",
      "'I was about to say,' she went on precisely, 'that it was a funny\n",
      "thing, a coincidence, seeing that I was already engaged, that the\n",

      "have asked me to come here, to the White City, with him tonight.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'It's a nuisance,' said Arthur, cheerily, 'when things clash like that.\n",
      "But perhaps he'll ask you again. Nothing to prevent you coming here\n",
      "twice. Well repays a second visit, I always say. I think--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You shouldn't,' said a voice behind him. 'It hurts the head. Well,\n",
      "kid, being shown a good time?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of meeting Mr Shute had not occurred to Maud. She had\n",
      "assumed that, being aware that she would be there with another, he\n",
      "would have stayed away. It may, however, be remarked that she did not\n",
      "know Mr Shute. He was not one of your sensitive plants. He smiled\n",
      "pleasantly upon her, looking very dapper in evening dress and a silk\n",
      "hat that, though a size too small for him, shone like a mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maud hardly knew whether she was glad or sorry to see him. It did not\n",
      "seem to matter much now either way. Nothing seemed to matter much, in\n",
      "fact. Arthur's cheery acceptance of the news that she received\n",
      "invitations from others had been like a blow, leaving her numb and\n",
      "listless.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made the introductions. The two men eyed each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Weather keeps up,' said Arthur.\n",
      "\n",

      "Considered as an embrace, it was imperfect. At these moments a silk\n",
      "hat a size too small handicaps a man. The necessity of having to be\n",
      "careful about the nap prevented Mr Shute from doing himself complete\n",
      "justice. But he did enough to induce Arthur Welsh, who, having sighted\n",

      "smartly on the side of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with the blows Mr Shute was wont to receive in the exercise of\n",
      "his profession, Arthur's was a gentle tap. But there was one\n",
      "circumstance which gave it a deadliness all its own. Achilles had his\n",
      "heel. Mr Shute's vulnerable point was at the other extremity. Instead\n",
      "of countering, he uttered a cry of agony, and clutched wildly with both\n",
      "hands at his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was too late. It fell to the ground and bounded away, with its\n",
      "proprietor in passionate chase. Arthur snorted and gently chafed his\n",
      "knuckles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a calm about Mr Shute's demeanour as, having given his\n",
      "treasure a final polish and laid it carefully down, he began to advance\n",
      "on his adversary, which was more than ominous. His lips were a thin\n",
      "line of steel. The muscles stood out over his jaw-bones. Crouching in\n",
      "his professional manner, he moved forward softly, like a cat.\n",
      "\n",

      "that Police-Constable Robert Bryce, intruding fourteen stones of bone\n",

      "pennies and produced tunes. His thoughts were of Jeanne Le Brocq, his\n",

      "during the rush hour. He had long worshipped her from afar, but nothing\n",

      "like a pig; he ate like a pig; he grunted like a pig. He had the lavish\n",

      "thumbs. Seven of these in all he visited on that black Thursday, and\n",
      "each of the seven rubbed the surface of the painting with a grimy\n",

      "fate of the picture, but bad in every other respect. M. Bredin,\n",
      "squatting behind the cash-desk, grunted fiercely at him; and, worse,\n",

      "\n",
      "Now it so happened that M. Bredin, when things went well with him, was\n",
      "wont to be filled with a ponderous amiability. It was not often that\n",
      "this took a practical form, though it is on record that in an exuberant\n",
      "moment he once gave a small boy a halfpenny. More frequently it merely\n",
      "led him to soften the porcine austerity of his demeanour. Today,\n",
      "business having been uncommonly good, he felt pleased with the world.\n",
      "He had left his cash-desk and was assailing a bowl of soup at one of\n",
      "the side-tables. Except for a belated luncher at the end of the room\n",
      "the place was empty. It was one of the hours when there was a lull in\n",
      "the proceedings at the Parisian Cafe. Paul was leaning, wrapped in the\n",
      "gloom, against the wall. Jeanne was waiting on the proprietor.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Bredin finished his meal and rose. He felt content. All was well\n",
      "with the world. As he lumbered to his desk he passed Jeanne. He\n",
      "stopped. He wheezed a compliment. Then another. Paul, from his place by\n",
      "the wall, watched with jealous fury.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Bredin chucked Jeanne under the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he did so, the belated luncher called 'Waiter!' but Paul was\n",
      "otherwise engaged. His entire nervous system seemed to have been\n",
      "stirred up with a pole. With a hoarse cry he dashed forward. He would\n",
      "destroy this pig who chucked his Jeanne under the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first intimation M. Bredin had of the declaration of war was the\n",
      "impact of a French roll on his ear. It was one of those nobbly, chunky\n",
      "rolls with sharp corners, almost as deadly as a piece of shrapnel. M.\n",
      "Bredin was incapable of jumping, but he uttered a howl and his vast\n",
      "body quivered like a stricken jelly. A second roll, whizzing by,\n",
      "slapped against the wall. A moment later a cream-bun burst in sticky\n",
      "ruin on the proprietor's left eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The belated luncher had been anxious to pay his bill and go, but he\n",
      "came swiftly to the conclusion that this was worth stopping on for. He\n",
      "leaned back in his chair and watched. M. Bredin had entrenched himself\n",
      "behind the cash-desk, peering nervously at Paul through the cream, and\n",
      "Paul, pouring forth abuse in his native tongue, was brandishing a\n",
      "chocolate eclair. The situation looked good to the spectator.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was spoiled by Jeanne, who seized Paul by the arm and shook him,\n",
      "adding her own voice to the babel. It was enough. The eclair fell to\n",
      "the floor. Paul's voice died away. His face took on again its crushed,\n",
      "hunted expression. The voice of M. Bredin, freed from competition, rose\n",
      "shrill and wrathful.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Fool! Idiot! Imbecile!' said Jeanne.\n",

      "is it to you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul was conscious of a dull longing for sympathy, a monstrous sense\n",
      "of oppression. Everything was going wrong. Surely Jeanne must be\n",
      "touched by his heroism? But no. She was scolding furiously. Suppose\n",
      "Andromeda had turned and scolded Perseus after he had slain the\n",
      "sea-monster! Paul mopped his forehead with his napkin. The bottom had\n",
      "dropped out of his world.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Jeanne!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bah! Do not talk to me, idiot of a little man. Almost you lost me my\n",
      "place also. The _patron_ was in two minds. But I coaxed him. A\n",
      "fine thing that would have been, to lose my good place through your\n",
      "foolishness. To throw rolls. My goodness!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She swept back into the room again, leaving Paul still standing by the\n",
      "kitchen door. Something seemed to have snapped inside him. How long he\n",
      "stood there he did not know, but presently from the dining-room came\n",
      "calls of 'Waiter!' and automatically he fell once more into his work,\n",
      "as an actor takes up his part. A stranger would have noticed nothing\n",
      "remarkable in him. He bustled to and fro with undiminished energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day M. Bredin paid him his eighteen shillings with a\n",
      "grunt, and Paul walked out of the restaurant a masterless man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to his attic and sat down on the bed. Propped up against the\n",
      "wall was the picture. He looked at it with unseeing eyes. He stared\n",
      "dully before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then thoughts came to him with a rush, leaping and dancing in his mind\n",
      "like imps in Hades. He had a curious sense of detachment. He seemed to\n",
      "be watching himself from a great distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the end. The little imps danced and leaped; and then one\n",
      "separated itself from the crowd, to grow bigger than, the rest, to\n",
      "pirouette more energetically. He rose. His mind was made up. He would\n",
      "kill himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went downstairs and out into the street. He thought hard as he\n",
      "walked. He would kill himself, but how?\n",
      "\n",
      "His preoccupation was so great that an automobile, rounding a corner,\n",
      "missed him by inches as he crossed the road. The chauffeur shouted\n",
      "angrily at him as he leapt back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul shook his fist at the retreating lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pig!' he shouted. 'Assassin! Scoundrel! Villain! Would you kill me? I\n",
      "will take your number, rascal. I will inform the police. Villain!'\n",
      "\n",
      "A policeman had strolled up and was eyeing him curiously. Paul turned\n",
      "to him, full of his wrongs.\n",

      "'Officer,' he cried, 'I have a complaint. These pigs of chauffeurs!\n",
      "They are reckless. They drive so recklessly. Hence the great number of\n",
      "accidents.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Awful!' said the policeman. 'Pass along, sonny.'\n",

      "It was quiet in the Park. He had chosen the Park because it was dark\n",
      "and there would be none to see and interfere. He waited long in the\n",
      "shadow by the roadside. Presently from the darkness there came the\n",
      "distant drone of powerful engines. Lights appeared, like the blazing\n",
      "eyes of a dragon swooping down to devour its prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran out into the road with a shout.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an error, that shout. He had intended it for an inarticulate\n",
      "farewell to his picture, to Jeanne, to life. It was excusable to the\n",
      "driver of the motor that he misinterpreted it. It seemed to him a cry\n",
      "of warning. There was a great jarring of brakes, a scuttering of locked\n",
      "wheels on the dry road, and the car came to a standstill a full yard\n",
      "from where he stood.\n",

      "Paul sat up, gulping convulsively. He was thoroughly unstrung. The\n",
      "cold, desperate mood had passed. In its place came the old feeling of\n",
      "desolation. He was a child, aching for sympathy. He wanted to tell his\n",
      "troubles. Punctuating his narrative with many gestures and an\n",

      "tragic end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost could I tell it in four words. In them one would say that it is\n",
      "set forth. There was in London at that time popular a song, a comic,\n",
      "vulgar song of the 'Alls, 'The Cat Came Back'. You 'ave 'eard it? Yes?\n",
      "I 'eard it myself, and without emotion. It had no sinister warning for\n",
      "me. It did not strike me as omen. Yet, in those four words, monsieur,\n",
      "is my tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "How? I shall tell you. Every word is a sword twisted in my 'eart, but I\n",

      "\n",
      "One afternoon we are at tea. All is well. I am vivacious, gay; Miss\n",

      "\n",
      "I am uneasy--but only yet vaguely, you will understand. I have not the\n",

      "Paris, of which you have spoken to me? Last night at dinner I have been\n",
      "seated beside her. At first I am not certain is it she. Then I say that\n",

      "the presence of a cat. Yet always the cat is there. It is terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that I am falling behind in the race. 'Er gratitude has made her\n",
      "the more gracious to Captain Bassett. She smiles upon him. And, like\n",
      "Chanticleer at the sight of the sun, he flaps his wings and crows. He\n",

      "back up, while Polly, standing before 'im, was telling 'im not to move\n",
      "or he would shoot. Nor did he move, till I 'ad seized the parrot and\n",
      "replaced him in the cage, when he shot upstairs like a streak of\n",

      "and Ruth served him, from ten to five, as a sort of secretary-clerk.\n",
      "Her duties, if monotonous, were simple. They consisted of sitting,\n",

      "mirth--not mocking laughter, but a kind of smiling happiness. It\n",
      "possessed that indefinable quality which characterizes the Billiken,\n",
      "due, perhaps, to the unquenchable optimism which shone through the\n",

      "endeavouring to bite his head off. The acquaintance, a gentleman of\n",

      "of a gourmet. An Irish terrier, with no personal bias towards either\n",

      "It takes a better man than Mr Warden to break up a gathering of this\n",
      "kind. The old gentleman was bewildered. He added his voice to the\n",
      "babel, and twice smote Bill grievously with his cane with blows\n",
      "intended for the acquaintance, but beyond that he effected nothing. It\n",
      "seemed probable that the engagement would last till the combatants had\n",
      "consumed each other, after the fashion of the Kilkenny cats, when there\n",
      "suddenly appeared from nowhere a young man in grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is divided into those who can stop dog-fights and those who\n",
      "cannot. The young man in grey belonged to the former class. Within a\n",
      "minute from his entrance on the scene the poodles and the Irish terrier\n",
      "had vanished; the dog of doubtful breed was moving off up the hill,\n",
      "yelping, with the dispatch of one who remembers an important\n",
      "appointment, and Bill, miraculously calmed, was seated in the centre of\n",
      "the Promenade, licking honourable wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Warden was disposed to effervesce with gratitude. The scene had\n",

      "for lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't mention it,' said the young man. 'I enjoy arbitrating in these\n",

      "brown eyes looking eagerly into hers in a manner which she thoroughly\n",
      "resented. She was not used to the other sex meeting her gaze and\n",
      "holding it as if confident of a friendly welcome. She made up her mind\n",

      "becoming aware that her companion's eyes were fixed on her face, turned\n",
      "her head, to meet a gaze of complete, not to say loving, admiration.\n",
      "She flushed. She was accustomed to being looked at admiringly, but\n",
      "about this particular look there was a subtle quality that\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "young men, and she resented it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've got it,' he declared, with relief. 'I knew I should, but these\n",
      "good things take time. Affinities are the zero on the roulette-board of\n",
      "life. Just as we select a number on which to stake our money, so do we\n",
      "select a type of girl whom we think we should like to marry. And just\n",
      "as zero pops up instead of the number, so does our affinity come along\n",

      "and polish it. But you see the idea. Take my case, for instance. When I\n",
      "saw you a couple of days ago I knew in an instant that you were my\n",
      "affinity. But for years I had been looking for a woman almost your\n",
      "exact opposite. You are dark. Three days ago I couldn't have imagined\n",
      "myself marrying anyone who was not fair. Your eyes are grey. Three days\n",

      "drooped timidly. Three days ago my passion for timid droopers amounted\n",
      "to an obsession.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth did not reply. It was useless to bandy words with one who gave\n",
      "such clear evidence of being something out of the common run of\n",
      "word-bandiers. No verbal attack could crush this extraordinary young\n",
      "man. She walked on, all silence and stony profile, uncomfortably\n",
      "conscious that her companion was in no way abashed by the former and\n",
      "was regarding the latter with that frank admiration which had made\n",
      "itself so obnoxious to her before, until they reached their destination.\n",

      "half a franc in his pocket, this comparative wealth being due to the\n",
      "fact that the minimum stake permitted by the Roville casino is just\n",
      "double that sum. He was sorry not to have won, but his mind was too\n",
      "full of rosy dreams to permit of remorse. It was the estimable old\n",
      "gentleman's dearest wish that his daughter should marry some rich,\n",
      "open-handed man who would keep him in affluence for the remainder of\n",
      "his days, and to that end he was in the habit of introducing to her\n",
      "notice any such that came his way. There was no question of coercing\n",
      "Ruth. He was too tender-hearted for that. Besides he couldn't. Ruth was\n",
      "not the sort of girl who is readily coerced. He contented himself with\n",

      "sociable place, and it was not unusual for him to make friends at the\n",
      "casino and to bring them home, when made, for a cigar. Up to the\n",
      "present, he was bound to admit, his efforts had not been particularly\n",
      "successful. Ruth, he reflected sadly, was a curious girl. She did not\n",

      "the very handsome way in which he had behaved in the matter of a small\n",

      "found Mr Warden in sore straits for want of a little capital to back a\n",
      "brand-new system which he had conceived through closely observing the\n",
      "run of the play. He was also obviously attracted by Ruth. And, as he\n",
      "was remarkably presentable--indeed, quite an unusually good-looking\n",

      "financially as well as physically, they had combined their superfluous\n",
      "cash and with it purchased a strip of land close to the sea. This land\n",
      "had been drained--to the huge discomfort of a colony of mosquitoes\n",
      "which had come to look on the place as their private property--and\n",
      "converted into links, which had become a sort of refuge for incompetent\n",
      "golfers. The members of the Cape Pleasant Club were easygoing refugees\n",
      "from other and more exacting clubs, men who pottered rather than raced\n",
      "round the links; men, in short, who had grown tired of having to stop\n",
      "their game and stand aside in order to allow perspiring experts to whiz\n",
      "past them. The Cape Pleasant golfers did not make themselves slaves to\n",
      "the game. Their language, when they foozled, was gently regretful\n",
      "rather than sulphurous. The moment in the day's play which they enjoyed\n",
      "most was when they were saying: 'Well, here's luck!' in the club-house.\n",

      "letters tied round with lilac ribbon. At country houses, where they\n",
      "lingered in the porch after dinner to watch the moonlight flooding the\n",
      "quiet garden, it was McCay and his colleague who lingered longest.\n",
      "McCay knew Ella Wheeler Wilcox by heart, and could take Browning\n",
      "without anaesthetics. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that\n",
      "Archibald's remark about his fiancee coming to live at Cape Pleasant\n",
      "should give him food for thought. It appealed to him.\n",

      "both had dined excellently, and were looking on the world with a sort\n",

      "melancholy--'do you know, there is something wonderfully pathetic to me\n",

      "'He ought to keep his eye on the ball,' said the more practical\n",

      "this championship.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If Archie's mutt enough to have told her that,' said Sigsbee\n",
      "decidedly, 'he deserves all he gets. Waiter, two Scotch highballs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "McCay was in no mood to subscribe to this stony-hearted view.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I tell you,' he said, 'I'm _sorry_ for Archie! I'm _sorry_\n",
      "for the poor old chap. And I'm more than sorry for the girl.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I don't see what we can do,' said Sigsbee. 'We can hardly be\n",

      "whether you win a tin medal or not?'\n",
      "\n",

      "wavered.\n",

      "\n",
      "McCay's face clouded. Gossett was an unpopular subject with members of\n",
      "the Cape Pleasant Golf Club. He was the serpent in their Eden. Nobody\n",
      "seemed quite to know how he had got in, but there, unfortunately, he\n",
      "was. Gossett had introduced into Cape Pleasant golf a cheerless\n",
      "atmosphere of the rigour of the game. It was to enable them to avoid\n",
      "just such golfers as Gossett that the Cape Pleasanters had founded\n",
      "their club. Genial courtesy rather than strict attention to the rules\n",
      "had been the leading characteristics of their play till his arrival. Up\n",
      "to that time it had been looked on as rather bad form to exact a\n",
      "penalty. A cheery give-and-take system had prevailed. Then Gossett had\n",
      "come, full of strange rules, and created about the same stir in the\n",
      "community which a hawk would create in a gathering of middle-aged\n",
      "doves.\n",

      "He was happy. It is true that Margaret's mother was not, as it were,\n",

      "appearance which we like to see in our mothers-in-law elect. On the\n",
      "contrary, she generally cried bitterly whenever she saw him, and at the\n",
      "end of ten minutes was apt to retire sobbing to her room, where she\n",
      "remained in a state of semi-coma till an advanced hour. She was by way\n",
      "of being a confirmed invalid, and something about Archibald seemed to\n",
      "get right in among her nerve centres, reducing them for the time being\n",
      "to a complicated hash. She did not like Archibald. She said she liked\n",
      "big, manly men. Behind his back she not infrequently referred to him as\n",
      "a 'gaby'; sometimes even as that 'guffin'.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not do this to Margaret, for Margaret, besides being blue-eyed,\n",
      "was also a shade quick-tempered. Whenever she discussed Archibald, it\n",
      "was with her son Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant Milsom, who thought Archibald a\n",
      "bit of an ass, was always ready to sit and listen to his mother on the\n",
      "subject, it being, however, an understood thing that at the conclusion\n",
      "of the seance she yielded one or two saffron-coloured bills towards his\n",
      "racing debts. For Stuyvesant, having developed a habit of backing\n",
      "horses which either did not start at all or else sat down and thought\n",
      "in the middle of the race, could always do with ten dollars or so. His\n",
      "prices for these interviews worked out, as a rule, at about three cents\n",

      "In these circumstances it was perhaps natural that Archibald and\n",
      "Margaret should prefer to meet, when they did meet, at some other spot\n",
      "than the Milsom home. It suited them both better that they should\n",
      "arrange a secret tryst on these occasions. Archibald preferred it\n",
      "because being in the same room as Mrs Milsom always made him feel like\n",
      "a murderer with particularly large feet; and Margaret preferred it\n",
      "because, as she told Archibald, these secret meetings lent a touch of\n",
      "poetry to what might otherwise have been a commonplace engagement.\n",

      "Archibald thought this charming; but at the same time he could not\n",
      "conceal from himself the fact that Margaret's passion for the poetic\n",
      "cut, so to speak, both ways. He admired and loved the loftiness of her\n",
      "soul, but, on the other hand, it was a tough job having to live up to\n",
      "it. For Archibald was a very ordinary young man. They had tried to\n",
      "inoculate him with a love of poetry at school, but it had not taken.\n",
      "Until he was thirty he had been satisfied to class all poetry (except\n",
      "that of Mr George Cohan) under the general heading of punk. Then he met\n",
      "Margaret, and the trouble began. On the day he first met her, at a\n",
      "picnic, she had looked so soulful, so aloof from this world, that he\n",
      "had felt instinctively that here was a girl who expected more from a\n",
      "man than a mere statement that the weather was great. It so chanced\n",
      "that he knew just one quotation from the classics, to wit, Tennyson's\n",
      "critique of the Island-Valley of Avilion. He knew this because he had\n",
      "had the passage to write out one hundred and fifty times at school, on\n",

      "happened to be a passionate admirer of the 'Idylls of the King'.\n",

      "\n",

      "of Avilion, where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, nor ever wind\n",

      "which he must not fall. He bought every new volume of poetry which was\n",
      "praised in the press, and learned the reviews by heart. Every evening\n",
      "he read painfully a portion of the classics. He plodded through the\n",
      "poetry sections of Bartlett's _Familiar Quotations_. Margaret's\n",
      "devotion to the various bards was so enthusiastic, and her reading so\n",
      "wide, that there were times when Archibald wondered if he could endure\n",

      "Archibald disposed of his first three opponents before the twelfth\n",
      "hole. He had been diffident when he teed off with McCay in the first\n",
      "round, but, finding that he defeated the secretary with ease, he met\n",
      "one Butler in the second round with more confidence. Butler, too, he\n",
      "routed; with the result that, by the time he faced Sigsbee in round\n",

      "the bunker at the seventh hole, Sigsbee became trapped as well. When he\n",
      "sliced at the sixth tee, Sigsbee pulled. And Archibald, striking a\n",

      "was a broker, had made some frivolous objection about the difficulty of\n",
      "absenting himself from Wall Street, but had been overruled. When\n",
      "Sigsbee pointed out that he could easily defeat Archibald and get to\n",
      "the city by lunch-time if he wished, and that in any case his partner\n",
      "would be looking after things, he allowed himself to be persuaded,\n",

      "Thursday morning suited Archibald admirably. It had occurred to him\n",

      "meet her at the end of the board-walk, which was about a mile from the\n",
      "links, at one o'clock, supply her with lunch, and spend the afternoon\n",
      "with her on the water. If he started his match with Gossett at\n",
      "eleven-thirty, he would have plenty of time to have his game and be at\n",
      "the end of the board-walk at the appointed hour. He had no delusions\n",
      "about the respective merits of Gossett and himself as golfers. He knew\n",
      "that Gossett would win the necessary ten holes off the reel. It was\n",
      "saddening, but it was a scientific fact. There was no avoiding it. One\n",
      "simply had to face it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having laid these plans, he caught the train on the Thursday morning\n",

      "At this point he reached in his pocket for his tobacco-pouch, to\n",
      "console himself with smoke. To his dismay he found it was not there. He\n",
      "had had it in the train, but now it had vanished. This added to his\n",
      "gloom, for the pouch had been given to him by Margaret, and he had\n",
      "always thought it one more proof of the way her nature towered over the\n",
      "natures of other girls that she had not woven a monogram on it in\n",
      "forget-me-nots. This record pouch was missing, and Archibald mourned\n",
      "for the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sorrows were not alleviated by the fact that Gossett won the fifth\n",
      "and sixth holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now a quarter past twelve, and Archibald reflected with moody\n",
      "satisfaction that the massacre must soon be over, and that he would\n",

      "As Gossett was about to drive off from the seventh tee, a telegraph boy\n",

      "'Mr Gossett,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett lowered his driver, and wheeled round, but Sigsbee had snatched\n",
      "the envelope from the boy's hand.\n",
      "\n",

      "for you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give it to me,' said Gossett anxiously. 'It may be from the office.\n",
      "Something may have happened to the market. I may be needed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, no,' said Sigsbee, soothingly. 'Don't you worry about it. Better\n",
      "not open it. It might have something in it that would put you off your\n",
      "stroke. Wait till the end of the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give it to me. I want to see it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Sigsbee was firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' he said. 'I'm here to see you win this championship and I won't\n",
      "have you taking any risks. Besides, even if it was important, a few\n",
      "minutes won't make any difference.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, at any rate, open it and read it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is probably in cipher,' said Sigsbee. 'I wouldn't understand it.\n",
      "Play on, old man. You've only a few more holes to win.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett turned and addressed his ball again. Then he swung. The club\n",
      "tipped the ball, and it rolled sluggishly for a couple of feet.\n",
      "Archibald approached the tee. Now there were moments when Archibald\n",
      "could drive quite decently. He always applied a considerable amount of\n",
      "muscular force to his efforts. It was in that direction, as a rule, he\n",
      "erred. On this occasion, whether inspired by his rival's failure or\n",
      "merely favoured by chance, he connected with his ball at precisely the\n",
      "right moment. It flew from the tee, straight, hard, and low, struck the\n",
      "ground near the green, bounded on and finally rocked to within a foot\n",
      "of the hole. No such long ball had been driven on the Cape Pleasant\n",
      "links since their foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it should have taken him three strokes to hole out from this\n",
      "promising position was unfortunate, but not fatal, for Gossett, who\n",
      "seemed suddenly to have fallen off his game, only reached the green in\n",
      "seven. A moment later a murmur of approval signified the fact that\n",
      "Archibald had won his first hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Gossett,' said a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those murmuring approval observed that the telegraph boy was once more\n",
      "in their midst. This time he bore two missives. Sigsbee dexterously\n",
      "impounded both.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' he said with decision. 'I absolutely refuse to let you look at\n",
      "them till the game is over. I know your temperament.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett gesticulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But they must be important. They must come from my office. Where else\n",
      "would I get a stream of telegrams? Something has gone wrong. I am\n",
      "urgently needed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Sigsbee nodded gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That is what I fear,' he said. 'That is why I cannot risk having you\n",
      "upset. Time enough, Gossett, for bad news after the game. Play on, man,\n",
      "and dismiss it from your mind. Besides, you couldn't get back to New\n",
      "York just yet, in any case. There are no trains. Dismiss the whole\n",
      "thing from your mind and just play your usual, and you're sure to win.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Archibald had driven off during this conversation, but without his\n",
      "previous success. This time he had pulled his ball into some long\n",
      "grass. Gossett's drive was, however, worse; and the subsequent movement\n",
      "of the pair to the hole resembled more than anything else the\n",
      "manoeuvres of two men rolling peanuts with toothpicks as the result of\n",
      "an election bet. Archibald finally took the hole in twelve after\n",
      "Gossett had played his fourteenth.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Archibald won the next in eleven and the tenth in nine, hope began\n",
      "to flicker feebly in his bosom. But when he won two more holes,\n",
      "bringing the score to like-as-we-lie, it flamed up within him like a\n",
      "beacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ordinary golfer, whose scores per hole seldom exceed those of\n",
      "Colonel Bogey, does not understand the whirl of mixed sensations which\n",
      "the really incompetent performer experiences on the rare occasions when\n",
      "he does strike a winning vein. As stroke follows stroke, and he\n",
      "continues to hold his opponent, a wild exhilaration surges through him,\n",
      "followed by a sort of awe, as if he were doing something wrong, even\n",
      "irreligious. Then all these yeasty emotions subside and are blended\n",
      "into one glorious sensation of grandeur and majesty, as of a giant\n",
      "among pygmies.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that Archibald, putting with the care of one brushing flies\n",
      "off a sleeping Venus, had holed out and won the thirteenth, he was in\n",
      "the full grip of this feeling. And as he walked to the fifteenth tee,\n",
      "after winning the fourteenth, he felt that this was Life, that till now\n",
      "he had been a mere mollusc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at that moment he happened to look at his watch, and the sight was\n",
      "like a douche of cold water. The hands stood at five minutes to one.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us pause and ponder on this point for a while. Let us not dismiss\n",
      "it as if it were some mere trivial, everyday difficulty. You, dear\n",
      "reader, play an accurate, scientific game and beat your opponent with\n",
      "ease every time you go the links, and so do I; but Archibald was not\n",
      "like us. This was the first occasion on which he had ever felt that he\n",
      "was playing well enough to give him a chance of defeating a really good\n",
      "man. True, he had beaten McCay, Sigsbee, and Butler in the earlier\n",
      "rounds; but they were ignoble rivals compared with Gossett. To defeat\n",
      "Gossett, however, meant the championship. On the other hand, he was\n",
      "passionately devoted to Margaret Milsom, whom he was due to meet at the\n",
      "end of the board-walk at one sharp. It was now five minutes to one, and\n",
      "the end of the board-walk still a mile away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mental struggle was brief but keen. A sharp pang, and his mind was\n",
      "made up. Cost what it might, he must stay on the links. If Margaret\n",
      "broke off the engagement--well, it might be that Time would heal the\n",
      "wound, and that after many years he would find some other girl for whom\n",
      "he might come to care in a wrecked, broken sort of way. But a chance\n",
      "like this could never come again. What is Love compared with holing out\n",
      "before your opponent?\n",
      "\n",
      "The excitement now had become so intense that a small boy, following\n",
      "with the crowd, swallowed his chewing-gum; for a slight improvement had\n",
      "become noticeable in Gossett's play, and a slight improvement in the\n",
      "play of almost anyone meant that it became vastly superior to\n",
      "Archibald's. At the next hole the improvement was not marked enough to\n",
      "have its full effect, and Archibald contrived to halve. This made him\n",
      "two up and three to play. What the average golfer would consider a\n",
      "commanding lead. But Archibald was no average golfer. A commanding\n",
      "lead for him would have been two up and one to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give the public of his best, your golfer should have his mind cool\n",
      "and intent upon the game. Inasmuch as Gossett was worrying about the\n",
      "telegrams, while Archibald, strive as he might to dismiss it, was\n",
      "haunted by a vision of Margaret standing alone and deserted on the\n",
      "board-walk, play became, as it were, ragged. Fine putting enabled\n",
      "Gossett to do the sixteenth hole in twelve, and when, winning the\n",
      "seventeenth in nine, he brought his score level with Archibald's the\n",
      "match seemed over. But just then--\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mr Gossett!' said a familiar voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more was the much-enduring telegraph boy among those present.\n",
      "\n",
      "'T'ree dis time!' he observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett sprang, but again the watchful Sigsbee was too swift.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Be brave, Gossett--be brave,' he said. 'This is a crisis in the game.\n",
      "Keep your nerve. Play just as if nothing existed outside the links. To\n",
      "look at these telegrams now would be fatal.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Eye-witnesses of that great encounter will tell the story of the last\n",
      "hole to their dying day. It was one of those Titanic struggles which\n",
      "Time cannot efface from the memory. Archibald was fortunate in getting\n",
      "a good start. He only missed twice before he struck his ball on the\n",
      "tee. Gossett had four strokes ere he achieved the feat. Nor did\n",
      "Archibald's luck desert him in the journey to the green. He was out of\n",
      "the bunker in eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gossett emerged only after sixteen. Finally, when Archibald's\n",
      "twenty-first stroke sent the ball trickling into the hole, Gossett\n",
      "had played his thirtieth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ball had hardly rested on the bottom of the hole before Gossett had\n",
      "begun to tear the telegrams from their envelopes. As he read, his eyes\n",
      "bulged in their sockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not bad news, I hope,' said a sympathetic bystander.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sigsbee took the sheaf of telegrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first ran: 'Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.' The second also ran:\n",
      "'Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.' So, singularly enough, did the third,\n",
      "fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Great Scott!' said Sigsbee. 'He seems to have been pretty anxious not\n",
      "to run any risk of missing you, Gossett.'\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, Archibald, close beside him, was looking at his watch. The\n",
      "hands stood at a quarter to two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret and her mother were seated in the parlour when Archibald\n",
      "arrived. Mrs Milsom, who had elicited the fact that Archibald had not\n",
      "kept his appointment, had been saying 'I told you so' for some time,\n",
      "and this had not improved Margaret's temper. When, therefore,\n",
      "Archibald, damp and dishevelled, was shown in, the chill in the air\n",
      "nearly gave him frost-bite. Mrs Milsom did her celebrated imitation of\n",
      "the Gorgon, while Margaret, lightly humming an air, picked up a weekly\n",
      "paper and became absorbed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Margaret, let me explain,' panted Archibald. Mrs Milsom was understood\n",
      "to remark that she dared say. Margaret's attention was riveted by a\n",
      "fashion plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Driving in a taximeter to the ferry this morning,' resumed Archibald,\n",
      "'I had an accident.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the result of some rather feverish brain-work on the way from\n",
      "the links to the cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The periodical flopped to the floor.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'What train did you catch?' asked Mrs Milsom sepulchrally.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The one o'clock. I came straight on here from the station.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said Margaret, 'Stuyvesant was coming home on the one o'clock\n",
      "train. Did you see him?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Archibald's jaw dropped slightly.\n",

      "\n",
      "He handed Archibald the missing pouch.\n",

      "'No, Archibald Mealing, he does _not_ mean this afternoon,' said\n",

      "Although this story is concerned principally with the Man and the Maid,\n",
      "the Miasma pervades it to such an extent that I feel justified in\n",
      "putting his name on the bills. Webster's Dictionary gives the meaning\n",
      "of the word 'miasma' as 'an infection floating in the air; a deadly\n",
      "exhalation'; and, in the opinion of Mr Robert Ferguson, his late\n",
      "employer, that description, though perhaps a little too flattering, on\n",
      "the whole summed up Master Roland Bean pretty satisfactorily. Until the\n",
      "previous day he had served Mr Ferguson in the capacity of office-boy;\n",
      "but there was that about Master Bean which made it practically\n",
      "impossible for anyone to employ him for long. A syndicate of Galahad,\n",
      "Parsifal, and Marcus Aurelius might have done it, but to an ordinary\n",
      "erring man, conscious of things done which should not have been done,\n",
      "and other things equally numerous left undone, he was too oppressive.\n",
      "One conscience is enough for any man. The employer of Master Bean had\n",
      "to cringe before two. Nobody can last long against an office-boy whose\n",
      "eyes shine with quiet, respectful reproof through gold-rimmed\n",
      "spectacles, whose manner is that of a middle-aged saint, and who\n",
      "obviously knows all the Plod and Punctuality books by heart and orders\n",

      "office; and he lingered on at his desk, after the day's work was done,\n",
      "for the same reason. Word had been brought to him earlier in the\n",
      "evening, that Master Roland Bean would like to see him. The answer to\n",
      "that was easy: 'Tell him I'm busy.' Master Bean's admirably dignified\n",

      "The reader may wonder what was the trouble--why Mr Ferguson could not\n",

      "station where the train stops three minutes.\n",

      "He was almost through.\n",
      "\n",

      "Men who have been hit by bullets say the first sensation is merely a\n",
      "sort of dull shock. So it was with Mr Ferguson. He stopped in his\n",
      "tracks and stared.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The porter closes the door at seven o'clock punctually, sir. It is now\n",
      "nearly twenty minutes after the hour.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Ferguson's brain was still in the numbed stage.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'During the night!'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He had anticipated an unpleasant five minutes in Master Bean's company.\n",
      "Imagination boggled at the thought of an unpleasant thirteen hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "He collapsed into a chair.\n",
      "\n",

      "prospective vigil, 'in the hope that I might persuade you, sir, to\n",
      "reconsider your decision in regard to my dismissal. I can assure you,\n",
      "sir, that I am extremely anxious to give satisfaction. If you would\n",
      "take me back and inform me how I have fallen short, I would endeavour\n",
      "to improve, I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We can't stop here all night,' interrupted Mr Ferguson, bounding from\n",
      "his chair and beginning to pace the floor.\n",

      "Mr Ferguson stared at him in dumb horror. He had a momentary vision of\n",
      "a sleepless night spent in listening to a nicely-polished speech for\n",
      "the defence. He was seized with a mad desire for flight. He could not\n",
      "leave the building, but he must get away somewhere and think.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dashed from the room and raced up the dark stairs. And as he arrived\n",
      "at the next floor his eye was caught by a thin pencil of light which\n",
      "proceeded from a door on the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "No shipwrecked mariner on a desert island could have welcomed the\n",
      "appearance of a sail with greater enthusiasm. He bounded at the door.\n",
      "He knew to whom the room belonged. It was the office of one Blaythwayt;\n",
      "and Blaythwayt was not only an acquaintance, but a sportsman. Quite\n",
      "possibly there might be a pack of cards on Blaythwayt's person to help\n",
      "pass the long hours. And if not, at least he would be company and his\n",
      "office a refuge. He flung open the door without going through the\n",
      "formality of knocking. Etiquette is not for the marooned.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I say, Blaythwayt--' he began, and stopped abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only occupant of the room was a girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I beg your pardon,' he said, 'I thought--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped again. His eyes, dazzled with the light, had not seen\n",
      "clearly. They did so now.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You!' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl looked at him, first with surprise, then with a cool\n",
      "hostility. There was a long pause. Eighteen months had passed since\n",
      "they had parted, and conversation does not flow easily after eighteen\n",
      "months of silence, especially if the nature of the parting has been\n",
      "bitter and stormy.\n",

      "He was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Blaythwayt's secretary, I have been here a fortnight. I have wondered\n",
      "if we should meet. I used to see you sometimes in the street.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never saw you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No?' she said indifferently.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Do you know we are locked in?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had expected wild surprise and dismay. She merely clicked her tongue\n",
      "in an annoyed manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Again!' she said. 'What a nuisance! I was locked in only a week ago.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her with unwilling respect, the respect of the novice for\n",
      "the veteran. She was nothing to him now, of course. She had passed out\n",
      "of his life. But he could not help remembering that long ago--eighteen\n",
      "months ago--what he had admired most in her had been this same spirit,\n",
      "this game refusal to be disturbed by Fate's blows. It braced him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down and looked curiously at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'So you left the stage?' he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "she, coldly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Is it? I often talk to strangers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What a bore they must think you!' she said, hiding one-eighth of a\n",
      "yawn with the tips of two fingers. 'I suppose,' she went on, with faint\n",
      "interest, 'you talk to them in trains when they are trying to read\n",
      "their paper?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't force my conversation on anyone.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you?' she said, raising her eyebrows in sweet surprise. 'Only\n",
      "your company--is that it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you alluding to the present occasion?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, you have an office of your own in this building, I believe.'\n",

      "'I have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then why--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am at perfect liberty,' he said, with dignity, 'to sit in my friend\n",
      "Blaythwayt's office if I choose. I wish to see Mr Blaythwayt.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'On business?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Very well,' she burst out; 'you have brought it on yourself. You've\n",
      "only yourself to blame. If you had been good and had gone back to your\n",
      "office, I would have brought you down some cake and cocoa.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cake and cocoa!' said he, superciliously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, cake and cocoa,' she snapped. 'It's all very well for you to turn\n",
      "up your nose at them now, but wait. You've thirteen hours of this in\n",
      "front of you. I know what it is. Last time I had to spend the night\n",
      "here I couldn't get to sleep for hours, and when I did I dreamed that I\n",
      "was chasing chocolate _eclairs_ round and round Trafalgar Square.\n",
      "And I never caught them either. Long before the night was finished I\n",
      "would have given _anything_ for even a dry biscuit. I made up my\n",

      "again--yes, smile. You'd better while you can.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smiling, but wanly. Nobody but a professional fasting man could\n",
      "have looked unmoved into the Inferno she had pictured. Then he rallied.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cake!' he said, scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cocoa!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Again that nod, ineffably sinister.\n",
      "\n",

      "that I must finish.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned to her desk, leaving him to his thoughts. They were not\n",
      "exhilarating. He had maintained a brave front, but inwardly he quailed.\n",
      "Reared in the country, he had developed at an early age a fine, healthy\n",
      "appetite. Once, soon after his arrival in London, he had allowed a\n",
      "dangerous fanatic to persuade him that the secret of health was to go\n",
      "without breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "His lunch that day had cost him eight shillings, and only decent shame\n",
      "had kept the figure as low as that. He knew perfectly well that long\n",
      "ere the dawn of day his whole soul would be crying out for cake,\n",
      "squealing frantically for cocoa. Would it not be better to--no, a\n",
      "thousand times no! Death, but not surrender. His self-respect was at\n",
      "stake. Looking back, he saw that his entire relations with this girl\n",
      "had been a series of battles of will. So far, though he had certainly\n",
      "not won, he had not been defeated. He must not be defeated now.\n",
      "\n",
      "He crossed his legs and sang a gay air under his breath.\n",

      "Mr Ferguson, deprived of the solace of song, filled in the time by\n",
      "gazing at the toiler's back-hair. It set in motion a train of\n",
      "thought--an express train bound for the Land of Yesterday. It recalled\n",
      "days in the woods, evenings on the lawn. It recalled sunshine--storm.\n",
      "Plenty of storm. Minor tempests that burst from a clear sky, apparently\n",
      "without cause, and the great final tornado. There had been cause enough\n",
      "for that. Why was it, mused Mr Ferguson, that every girl in every\n",
      "country town in every county of England who had ever recited 'Curfew\n",
      "shall not ring tonight' well enough to escape lynching at the hands of\n",
      "a rustic audience was seized with the desire to come to London and go\n",
      "on the stage?\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please don't snort,' said a cold voice, from behind the back-hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a train-wreck in the Land of Yesterday. Mr Ferguson, the\n",
      "only survivor, limped back into the Present.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Present had little charm, but at least it was better than the\n",
      "cakeless Future. He fixed his thoughts on it. He wondered how Master\n",
      "Bean was passing the time. Probably doing deep-breathing exercises, or\n",
      "reading a pocket Aristotle. The girl pushed back her chair and rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went to a small cupboard in the corner of the room, and from it\n",
      "produced in instalments all that goes to make cake and cocoa. She did\n",
      "not speak. Presently, filling Space, there sprang into being an Odour;\n",
      "and as it reached him Mr Ferguson stiffened in his chair, bracing\n",
      "himself as for a fight to the death. It was more than an odour. It was\n",
      "the soul of the cocoa singing to him. His fingers gripped the arms of\n",
      "the chair. This was the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl separated a section of cake from the parent body. She caught\n",
      "his eye.\n",
      "\n",

      "may--but I forgot, you don't like cocoa.'\n",

      "\n",
      "'Are you forgetting that I was engaged to you for several weeks?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was too startled to be hurt. The idea of himself as a Roland Bean\n",
      "was too new to be assimilated immediately. It called for meditation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Was I like that?' he said at last, almost humbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You know you were. Oh, I'm not thinking only about your views on the\n",

      "like a--like a--like an aunt,' she concluded triumphantly. 'You were\n",
      "too good for anything. If only you would, just once, have done\n",

      "\n",
      "The effect that Keggs, the butler at the Keiths', had on Martin\n",
      "Rossiter was to make him feel as if he had been caught laughing in a\n",
      "cathedral. He fought against the feeling. He asked himself who Keggs\n",
      "was, anyway; and replied defiantly that Keggs was a Menial--and an\n",

      "\n",
      "When the Keiths had invited him to their country home he had been\n",
      "delighted. They were among his oldest friends. He liked Mr Keith. He\n",
      "liked Mrs Keith. He loved Elsa Keith, and had done so from boyhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things had gone wrong. As he leaned out of his bedroom window at\n",
      "the end of the first week, preparatory to dressing for dinner, he was\n",
      "more than half inclined to make some excuse and get right out of the\n",

      "of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it Keggs alone who had driven his thoughts towards flight.\n",
      "Keggs was merely a passive evil, like toothache or a rainy day. What\n",
      "had begun actively to make the place impossible was a perfectly\n",
      "pestilential young man of the name of Barstowe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house-party at the Keiths had originally been, from Martin's\n",
      "view-point, almost ideal. The rest of the men were of the speechless,\n",
      "moustache-tugging breed. They had come to shoot, and they shot. When\n",
      "they were not shooting they congregated in the billiard-room and\n",
      "devoted their powerful intellects exclusively to snooker-pool, leaving\n",
      "Martin free to talk undisturbed to Elsa. He had been doing this for\n",
      "five days with great contentment when Aubrey Barstowe arrived. Mrs\n",
      "Keith had developed of late leanings towards culture. In her town house\n",
      "a charge of small-shot, fired in any direction on a Thursday\n",
      "afternoon, could not have failed to bring down a poet, a novelist, or a\n",
      "painter. Aubrey Barstowe, author of _The Soul's Eclipse_ and other\n",
      "poems, was a constant member of the crowd. A youth of insinuating\n",
      "manners, he had appealed to Mrs Keith from the start; and unfortunately\n",
      "the virus had extended to Elsa. Many a pleasant, sunshiny Thursday\n",
      "afternoon had been poisoned for Martin by the sight of Aubrey and Elsa\n",
      "together on a distant settee, matching temperaments. The rest is too\n",
      "painful. It was a rout. The poet did not shoot, so that when Martin\n",
      "returned of an evening his rival was about five hours of soul-to-soul\n",
      "talk up and only two to play. And those two, the after-dinner hours,\n",
      "which had once been the hours for which Martin had lived, were pure\n",
      "torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "So engrossed was he with his thoughts that the first intimation he had\n",
      "that he was not alone in the room was a genteel cough. Behind him,\n",
      "holding a small can, was Keggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your 'ot water, sir,' said the butler, austerely but not unkindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keggs was a man--one must use that word, though it seems grossly\n",
      "inadequate--of medium height, pigeon-toed at the base, bulgy half-way\n",
      "up, and bald at the apex. His manner was restrained and dignified, his\n",
      "voice soft and grave.\n",
      "\n",

      "'It is Frederick's duty, but tonight I hundertook it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had no answer. He was dazed. Keggs had spoken with the proud\n",

      "\n",
      "'Might I have a word with you, sir?'\n",
      "\n",

      "certainly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is perhaps a liberty,' began Keggs. He paused, and raked Martin\n",

      "\n",
      "'Not at all,' said Martin, hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Women, sir,' proceeded Keggs, 'young ladies--are peculiar. I have had,\n",
      "if I may say so, certain hopportunities of observing their ways. Miss\n",
      "Elsa reminds me in some respects of Lady Angelica Fendall, whom I had\n",
      "the honour of knowing when I was butler to her father, Lord Stockleigh.\n",
      "Her ladyship was hinclined to be romantic. She was fond of poetry, like\n",
      "Miss Elsa. She would sit by the hour, sir, listening to young Mr Knox\n",
      "reading Tennyson, which was no part of his duties, he being employed by\n",
      "his lordship to teach Lord Bertie Latin and Greek and what not. You may\n",
      "have noticed, sir, that young ladies is often took by Tennyson,\n",
      "hespecially in the summertime. Mr Barstowe was reading Tennyson to Miss\n",
      "Elsa in the 'all when I passed through just now. _The Princess_,\n",
      "if I am not mistaken.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know what the thing was,' groaned Martin. 'She seemed to be\n",
      "enjoying it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lady Angelica was greatly addicted to _The Princess_. Young Mr\n",
      "Knox was reading portions of that poem to her when his lordship come\n",
      "upon them. Most rashly his lordship made a public hexpose and packed Mr\n",
      "Knox off next day. It was not my place to volunteer advice, but I could\n",
      "have told him what would happen. Two days later her ladyship slips away\n",
      "to London early in the morning, and they're married at a\n",
      "registry-office. That is why I say that you are going the wrong way to\n",
      "work with Miss Elsa, sir. With certain types of 'igh spirited young lady\n",
      "hopposition is useless. Now, when Mr Barstowe was reading to Miss Elsa\n",
      "on the occasion to which I 'ave alluded, you were sitting by, trying to\n",
      "engage her attention. It's not the way, sir. You should leave them\n",
      "alone together. Let her see so much of him, and nobody else but him,\n",
      "that she will grow tired of him. Fondness for poetry, sir, is very much\n",
      "like the whisky 'abit. You can't cure a man what has got that by\n",
      "hopposition. Now, if you will permit me to offer a word of advice, sir,\n",
      "I say, let Miss Elsa 'ave all the poetry she wants.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was conscious of one coherent feeling at the conclusion of this\n",
      "address, and that was one of amazed gratitude. A lesser man who had\n",
      "entered his room and begun to discuss his private affairs would have\n",
      "had reason to retire with some speed; but that Keggs should descend\n",
      "from his pedestal and interest himself in such lowly matters was a\n",
      "different thing altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm very much obliged--' he was stammering, when the butler raised a\n",
      "deprecatory hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My interest in the matter,' he said, smoothly, 'is not entirely\n",
      "haltruistic. For some years back, in fact, since Miss Elsa came out, we\n",
      "have had a matrimonial sweepstake in the servants' hall at each\n",
      "house-party. The names of the gentlemen in the party are placed in a hat\n",
      "and drawn in due course. Should Miss Elsa become engaged to any member\n",
      "of the party, the pool goes to the drawer of his name. Should no\n",
      "engagement occur, the money remains in my charge until the following\n",
      "year, when it is added to the new pool. Hitherto I have 'ad the\n",
      "misfortune to draw nothing but married gentlemen, but on this occasion\n",
      "I have secured you, sir. And I may tell you, sir,' he added, with\n",
      "stately courtesy, 'that, in the opinion of the servants' hall, your\n",
      "chances are 'ighly fancied,--very 'ighly. The pool has now reached\n",
      "considerable proportions, and, 'aving had certain losses on the Turf\n",
      "very recent, I am extremely anxious to win it. So I thought, if I might\n",
      "take the liberty, sir, I would place my knowledge of the sex at your\n",
      "disposal. You will find it sound in every respect. That is all. Thank\n",
      "you, sir.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin's feelings had undergone a complete revulsion. In the last few\n",

      "a forked tail. His rage deprived him of words. He could only gurgle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't thank me, sir,' said the butler, indulgently. 'I ask no thanks.\n",
      "We are working together for a common hobject, and any little 'elp I can\n",
      "provide is given freely.'\n",
      "\n",

      "that blue eye. 'You have the insolence to come to me and--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped. The thought of these hounds, these demons, coolly gossiping\n",

      "Owen Bentley was feeling embarrassed. He looked at Mr Sheppherd, and\n",
      "with difficulty restrained himself from standing on one leg and\n",
      "twiddling his fingers. At one period of his career, before the\n",
      "influence of his uncle Henry had placed him in the London and Suburban\n",
      "Bank, Owen had been an actor. On the strength of a batting average of\n",
      "thirty-three point nought seven for Middlesex, he had been engaged by\n",
      "the astute musical-comedy impresario to whom the idea first occurred\n",
      "that, if you have got to have young men to chant 'We are merry and gay,\n",
      "tra-la, for this is Bohemia,' in the Artists' Ball scene, you might\n",
      "just as well have young men whose names are known to the public. He had\n",
      "not been an actor long, for loss of form had put him out of first-class\n",
      "cricket, and the impresario had given his place in the next piece to a\n",
      "googly bowler who had done well in the last Varsity match; but he had\n",
      "been one long enough to experience that sinking sensation which is\n",
      "known as stage-fright. And now, as he began to explain to Mr Sheppherd\n",
      "that he wished for his consent to marry his daughter Audrey, he found\n",
      "himself suffering exactly the same symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the very start, from the moment when he revealed the fact that his\n",
      "income, salary and private means included, amounted to less than two\n",
      "hundred pounds, he had realized that this was going to be one of his\n",
      "failures. It was the gruesome Early Victorianness of it all that took\n",
      "the heart out of him. Mr Sheppherd had always reminded him of a heavy\n",
      "father out of a three-volume novel, but, compared with his demeanour as\n",
      "he listened now, his attitude hitherto had been light and whimsical.\n",
      "Until this moment Owen had not imagined that this sort of thing ever\n",
      "happened nowadays outside the comic papers. By the end of the second\n",
      "minute he would not have been surprised to find himself sailing through\n",
      "the air, urged by Mr Sheppherd's boot, his transit indicated by a\n",
      "dotted line and a few stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Sheppherd's manner was inclined to bleakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This is most unfortunate,' he said. 'Most unfortunate. I have my\n",
      "daughter's happiness to consider. It is my duty as a father.' He\n",
      "paused. 'You say you have no prospects? I should have supposed that\n",
      "your uncle--? Surely, with his influence--?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'My uncle shot his bolt when he got me into the bank. That finished\n",

      "are about a hundred others, all trailing him like bloodhounds.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Sheppherd coughed the small cough of disapproval. He was feeling\n",
      "more than a little aggrieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had met Owen for the first time at dinner at the house of his uncle\n",
      "Henry, a man of unquestioned substance, whose habit it was to invite\n",
      "each of his eleven nephews to dinner once a year. But Mr Sheppherd did\n",
      "not know this. For all he knew, Owen was in the habit of hobnobbing\n",
      "with the great man every night. He could not say exactly that it was\n",
      "sharp practice on Owen's part to accept his invitation to call, and,\n",
      "having called, to continue calling long enough to make the present\n",
      "deplorable situation possible; but he felt that it would have been in\n",
      "better taste for the young man to have effaced himself and behaved more\n",
      "like a bank-clerk and less like an heir.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am exceedingly sorry for this, Mr Bentley,' he said, 'but you will\n",

      "'--after today. Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen left the room. Audrey was hovering in the neighbourhood of the\n",
      "door. She came quickly up to him, and his spirits rose, as they always\n",
      "did, at the sight of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well?' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",

      "\n",
      "'I wish I could make some money,' said Owen, thoughtfully. 'But I seem\n",
      "to be one of those chaps who can't. Nothing I try comes off. I've never\n",
      "drawn anything except a blank in a sweep. I spent about two pounds on\n",
      "sixpenny postal orders when the Limerick craze was on, and didn't win a\n",
      "thing. Once when I was on tour I worked myself to a shadow, dramatizing\n",
      "a novel. Nothing came of that, either.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What novel?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A thing called _White Roses,_ by a woman named Edith Butler.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'I suppose you knew her very well? Were you great friends?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know her at all. I'd never met her. I just happened to buy\n",
      "the thing at a bookstall, and thought it would make a good play. I\n",
      "expect it was pretty bad rot. Anyhow, she never took the trouble to\n",
      "send it back or even to acknowledge receipt.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps she never got it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I registered it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She was a cat,' said Audrey, decidedly. 'I'm glad of it, though. If\n",
      "another woman had helped you make a lot of money, I should have died of\n",
      "jealousy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Routine is death to heroism. For the first few days after his parting\n",
      "with Mr Sheppherd, Owen was in heroic mood, full of vaguely dashing\n",
      "schemes, regarding the world as his oyster, and burning to get at it,\n",
      "sword in hand. But routine, with its ledgers and its copying-ink and\n",
      "its customers, fell like a grey cloud athwart his horizon, blotting out\n",
      "rainbow visions of sudden wealth, dramatically won. Day by day the glow\n",
      "faded and hopelessness grew.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the glow did not entirely fade it was due to Audrey, who more than\n",
      "fulfilled her promise of ringing him up on the telephone. She rang him\n",
      "up at least once, frequently several times, every day, a fact which was\n",
      "noted and commented upon in a harshly critical spirit by the head of\n",
      "his department, a man with no soul and a strong objection to doing his\n",
      "subordinates' work for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule, her conversation, though pleasing, was discursive and lacked\n",
      "central motive, but one morning she had genuine news to impart.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Owen'--her voice was excited--'have you seen the paper today? Then\n",
      "listen. I'll read it out. Are you listening? This is what it says: \"The\n",

      "Miss Edith Butler's popular novel, _White Roses_, prepared by the\n",
      "authoress herself. A strong cast is being engaged, including--\" And\n",

      "\n",
      "'Don't you see what's happened? That awful woman has stolen your play.\n",

      "'I thought you said you didn't know her,' said Audrey, jealously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't--I don't,' said Owen, hastily. 'But I've read her books.\n",
      "They're simply chunks of superfatted sentiment. She's a sort of\n",
      "literary onion. She compels tears. A woman like that couldn't steal a\n",
      "play if she tried.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can't judge authors from their books. You must go and see the play\n",
      "when it comes on. Then you'll see I'm right. I'm absolutely certain\n",
      "that woman is trying to swindle you. Don't laugh in that horrid way.\n",
      "Very well, I told you I should ring off, and now I'm going to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of the next month Owen's annual holiday arrived. The\n",
      "authorities of the London and Suburban Bank were no niggards. They\n",
      "recognized that a man is not a machine. They gave their employees ten\n",
      "days in the year in which to tone up their systems for another twelve\n",
      "months' work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen spent his boyhood in the Shropshire village of which his father\n",
      "had been rector, and thither he went when his holiday came round, to\n",
      "the farm of one Dorman. He was glad of the chance to get to Shropshire.\n",
      "There is something about the country there, with its green fields and\n",
      "miniature rivers, that soothes the wounded spirit and forms a pleasant\n",
      "background for sentimental musings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was comfortable at the farm. The household consisted of Mr Dorman,\n",
      "an old acquaintance, his ten-year-old son George, and Mr Dorman's\n",
      "mother, an aged lady with a considerable local reputation as a wise\n",
      "woman. Rumour had it that the future held no mysteries for her, and it\n",
      "was known that she could cure warts, bruised fingers, and even the\n",
      "botts by means of spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except for these, Owen had fancied that he was alone in the house. It\n",
      "seemed not, however. There was a primeval piano in his sitting-room,\n",
      "and on the second morning it suited his mood to sit down at this and\n",
      "sing 'Asthore', the fruity pathos of which ballad appealed to him\n",
      "strongly at this time, accompanying himself by an ingenious arrangement\n",
      "in three chords. He had hardly begun, however, when Mr Dorman appeared,\n",
      "somewhat agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you don't mind, Mr Owen,' he said. 'I forgot to tell you. There's a\n",
      "lit'ery gent boarding with me in the room above, and he can't bear to\n",
      "be disturbed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A muffled stamping from the ceiling bore out his words.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Writing a book he is,' continued Mr Dorman. 'He caught young George a\n",
      "clip over the ear-'ole yesterday for blowing his trumpet on the stairs.\n",
      "Gave him sixpence afterwards, and said he'd skin him if he ever did it\n",
      "again. So, if you don't mind--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, all right,' said Owen. 'Who is he?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Gentleman of the name of Prosser.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen could not recollect having come across any work by anyone of that\n",
      "name; but he was not a wide reader; and, whether the man above was a\n",
      "celebrity or not, he was entitled to quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never heard of him,' he said, 'but that's no reason why I should\n",
      "disturb him. Let him rip. I'll cut out the musical effects in future.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The days passed smoothly by. The literary man remained invisible,\n",
      "though occasionally audible, tramping the floor in the frenzy of\n",
      "composition. Nor, until the last day of his visit, did Owen see old Mrs\n",
      "Dorman.\n",
      "\n",
      "That she was not unaware of his presence in the house, however, was\n",
      "indicated on the last morning. He was smoking an after-breakfast pipe\n",
      "at the open window and waiting for the dog-cart that was to take him to\n",
      "the station, when George, the son of the house, entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "George stood in the doorway, grinned, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Farsezjerligranmatellyerforchbythecards?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Eh?' said Owen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth repeated the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second repetition light began to creep in. A boyhood spent in\n",
      "the place, added to this ten days' stay, had made Owen something of a\n",
      "linguist.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father says would I like grandma to do what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell yer forch'n by ther cards.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where is she?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Backyarnder.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen followed him into the kitchen, where he found Mr Dorman, the\n",
      "farmer, and, seated at the table, fumbling with a pack of cards, an old\n",
      "woman, whom he remembered well.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mother wants to tell your fortune,' said Mr Dorman, in a hoarse aside.\n",
      "'She always will tell visitors' fortunes. She told Mr Prosser's, and he\n",
      "didn't half like it, because she said he'd be engaged in two months and\n",
      "married inside the year. He said wild horses wouldn't make him do it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She can tell me that if she likes. I shan't object.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mother, here's Mr Owen.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I seed him fast enough,' said the old woman, briskly. 'Shuffle, an' cut\n",
      "three times.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She then performed mysterious manoeuvres with the cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I see pots o' money,' announced the sibyl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If she says it, it's there right enough,' said her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "'She means my bonus,' said Owen. 'But that's only ten pounds. And I lose\n",
      "it if I'm late twice more before Christmas.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It'll come sure enough.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pots,' said the old woman, and she was still mumbling the encouraging\n",
      "word when Owen left the kitchen and returned to the sitting-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed rather ruefully. At that moment he could have found a use\n",
      "for pots o' money.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked to the window, and looked out. It was a glorious morning. The\n",
      "heat-mist was dancing over the meadow beyond the brook, and from the\n",
      "farmyard came the liquid charawks of care-free fowls. It seemed wicked\n",
      "to leave these haunts of peace for London on such a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "An acute melancholy seized him. Absently, he sat down at the piano. The\n",
      "prejudices of literary Mr Prosser had slipped from his mind. Softly at\n",
      "first, then gathering volume as the spirit of the song gripped him, he\n",
      "began to sing 'Asthore'. He became absorbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just, for the sixth time, won through to 'Iyam-ah waiting for-er\n",
      "theeee-yass-thorre,' and was doing some intricate three-chord work\n",
      "preparatory to starting over again, when a loaf of bread whizzed past\n",
      "his ear. It missed him by an inch, and crashed against a plaster\n",
      "statuette of the Infant Samuel on the top of the piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a standard loaf, containing eighty per cent of semolina, and it\n",
      "practically wiped the Infant Samuel out of existence. At the same\n",
      "moment, at his back, there sounded a loud, wrathful snort.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spun round. The door was open, and at the other side of the table\n",
      "was standing a large, black-bearded, shirt-sleeved man, in an attitude\n",
      "rather reminiscent of Ajax defying the lightning. His hands trembled.\n",
      "His beard bristled. His eyes gleamed ferociously beneath enormous\n",
      "eyebrows. As Owen turned, he gave tongue in a voice like the discharge\n",
      "of a broadside.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stop it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen's mind, wrenched too suddenly from the dreamy future to the vivid\n",
      "present, was not yet completely under control. He gaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stop--that--infernal--noise!' roared the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shot through the door, banging it after him, and pounded up the\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen was annoyed. The artistic temperament was all very well, but\n",
      "there were limits. It was absurd that obscure authors should behave in\n",
      "this way. Prosser! Who on earth was Prosser? Had anyone ever heard of\n",
      "him? No! Yet here he was going about the country clipping small boys\n",
      "over the ear-hole, and flinging loaves of bread at bank-clerks as if he\n",
      "were Henry James or Marie Corelli. Owen reproached himself bitterly for\n",
      "his momentary loss of presence of mind. If he had only kept his head,\n",
      "he could have taken a flying shot at the man with the marmalade-pot. It\n",
      "had been within easy reach. Instead of which, he had merely stood and\n",
      "gaped. Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, 'It\n",
      "might have been.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His manly regret was interrupted by the entrance of Mr Dorman with the\n",
      "information that the dog-cart was at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey was out of town when Owen arrived in London, but she returned a\n",
      "week later. The sound of her voice through the telephone did much to\n",
      "cure the restlessness from which he had been suffering since the\n",
      "conclusion of his holiday. But the thought that she was so near yet so\n",
      "inaccessible produced in him a meditative melancholy which enveloped\n",
      "him like a cloud that would not lift. His manner became distrait. He\n",
      "lost weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "If customers were not vaguely pained by his sad, pale face, it was only\n",
      "because the fierce rush of modern commercial life leaves your business\n",
      "man little leisure for observing pallor in bank-clerks. What did pain\n",
      "them was the gentle dreaminess with which he performed his duties. He\n",
      "was in the Inward Bills Department, one of the features of which was\n",
      "the sudden inrush, towards the end of each afternoon, of hatless,\n",
      "energetic young men with leather bags strapped to their left arms,\n",
      "clamouring for mysterious crackling documents, much fastened with pins.\n",
      "Owen had never quite understood what it was that these young men did\n",
      "want, and now his detached mind refused even more emphatically to\n",
      "grapple with the problem. He distributed the documents at random with\n",
      "the air of a preoccupied monarch scattering largess to the mob, and the\n",
      "subsequent chaos had to be handled by a wrathful head of the department\n",
      "in person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Man's power of endurance is limited. At the end of the second week the\n",
      "overwrought head appealed passionately for relief, and Owen was removed\n",
      "to the Postage Department, where, when he had leisure from answering\n",
      "Audrey's telephone calls, he entered the addresses of letters in a\n",
      "large book and took them to the post. He was supposed also to stamp\n",
      "them, but a man in love cannot think of everything, and he was apt at\n",
      "times to overlook this formality.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, receiving from one of the bank messengers the usual\n",
      "intimation that a lady wished to speak to him on the telephone, he went\n",
      "to the box and took up the receiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that you, Owen? Owen, I went to _White Roses_ last night. Have\n",
      "you been yet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you must go tonight. Owen, I'm _certain_ you wrote it. It's\n",
      "perfectly lovely. I cried my eyes out. If you don't go tonight, I'll\n",
      "never speak to you again, even on the telephone. Promise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Must I?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, you must. Why, suppose it _is_ yours! It may mean a fortune.\n",
      "The stalls were simply packed. I'm going to ring up the theatre now and\n",
      "engage a seat for you, and pay for it myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No--I say--' protested Owen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, I shall. I can't trust you to go if I don't. And I'll ring up\n",
      "early tomorrow to hear all about it. Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen left the box somewhat depressed. Life was quite gloomy enough as\n",
      "it was, without going out of one's way to cry one's eyes out over\n",
      "sentimental plays.\n",
      "\n",
      "His depression was increased by the receipt, on his return to his\n",
      "department, of a message from the manager, stating that he would like\n",
      "to see Mr Bentley in his private room for a moment. Owen never enjoyed\n",
      "these little chats with Authority. Out of office hours, in the circle\n",
      "of his friends, he had no doubt the manager was a delightful and\n",
      "entertaining companion; but in his private room his conversation was\n",
      "less enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager was seated at his table, thoughtfully regarding the\n",
      "ceiling. His resemblance to a stuffed trout, always striking, was\n",
      "subtly accentuated, and Owen, an expert in these matters, felt that his\n",
      "fears had been well founded--there was trouble in the air. Somebody had\n",
      "been complaining of him, and he was now about, as the phrase went, to\n",
      "be 'run-in'.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large man, seated with his back to the door, turned as he entered,\n",
      "and Owen recognized the well-remembered features of Mr Prosser, the\n",
      "literary loaf-slinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen regarded him without resentment. Since returning to London he had\n",
      "taken the trouble of looking up his name in _Who's Who_ and had\n",
      "found that he was not so undistinguished as he had supposed. He was, it\n",
      "appeared, a Regius Professor and the author of some half-dozen works on\n",
      "sociology--a record, Owen felt, that almost justified loaf-slinging and\n",
      "ear-hole clipping in moments of irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager started to speak, but the man of letters anticipated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is this the fool?' he roared. 'Young man, I have no wish to be hard on\n",
      "a congenital idiot who is not responsible for his actions, but I must\n",
      "insist on an explanation. I understand that you are in charge of the\n",
      "correspondence in this office. Well, during the last week you have\n",
      "three times sent unstamped letters to my fiancee, Miss Vera Delane,\n",
      "Woodlands, Southbourne, Hants. What's the matter with you? Do you think\n",
      "she likes paying twopence a time, or what is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen's mind leaped back at the words. They recalled something to him.\n",
      "Then he remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conscious of a not unpleasant thrill. He had not known that he\n",
      "was superstitious, but for some reason he had not been able to get\n",
      "those absurd words of Mr Dorman's mother out of his mind. And here was\n",
      "another prediction of hers, equally improbable, fulfilled to the\n",
      "letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Great Scott!' he cried. 'Are you going to be married?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Prosser and the manager started simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mrs Dorman said you would be,' said Owen. 'Don't you remember?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Prosser looked keenly at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, I've seen you before,' he said. 'You're the young turnip-headed\n",
      "scallywag at the farm.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's right,' said Owen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've been wanting to meet you again. I thought the whole thing over,\n",
      "and it struck me,' said Mr Prosser, handsomely, 'that I may have seemed\n",
      "a little abrupt at our last meeting.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, no.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The fact is, I was in the middle of an infernally difficult passage of\n",
      "my book that morning, and when you began--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was my fault entirely. I quite understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Prosser produced a card-case.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must see more of each other,' he said. 'Come and have a bit of\n",
      "dinner some night. Come tonight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm very sorry. I have to go to the theatre tonight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then come and have a bit of supper afterwards. Excellent. Meet me at\n",
      "the Savoy at eleven-fifteen. I'm glad I didn't hit you with that loaf.\n",
      "Abruptness has been my failing through life. My father was just the\n",
      "same. Eleven-fifteen at the Savoy, then.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager, who had been listening with some restlessness to the\n",
      "conversation, now intervened. He was a man with a sense of fitness of\n",
      "things, and he objected to having his private room made the scene of\n",
      "what appeared to be a reunion of old college chums. He hinted as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ha! Prrumph!' he observed, disapprovingly. 'Er--Mr Bentley, that is\n",
      "all. You may return to your work--ah'mmm! Kindly be more careful\n",
      "another time in stamping the letters.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, by Jove,' said Mr Prosser, suddenly reminded of his wrongs,\n",
      "'that's right. Exercise a little ordinary care, you ivory-skulled\n",
      "young son of a gun. Do you think Miss Delane is _made_ of\n",
      "twopences? Keep an eye on him,' he urged the manager. 'These young\n",
      "fellows nowadays want someone standing over them with a knout all the\n",
      "time. Be more careful another time, young man. Eleven-fifteen,\n",
      "remember. Make a note of it, or you'll go forgetting _that_.'\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The seat Audrey had bought for him at the Piccadilly Theatre proved to\n",
      "be in the centre of the sixth row of stalls--practically a death-trap.\n",
      "Whatever his sufferings might be, escape was impossible. He was\n",
      "securely wedged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cheaper parts of the house were sparsely occupied, but the stalls\n",
      "were full. Owen, disapproving of the whole business, refused to buy a\n",
      "programme, and settled himself in his seat prepared for the worst. He\n",
      "had a vivid recollection of _White Roses_, the novel, and he did\n",
      "not anticipate any keen enjoyment from it in its dramatized form. He\n",
      "had long ceased to be a member of that large public for which Miss\n",
      "Edith Butler catered. The sentimental adventures of governesses in\n",
      "ducal houses--the heroine of _White Roses_ was a governess--no\n",
      "longer contented his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is always a curiously dream-like atmosphere about a play founded\n",
      "on a book. One seems to have seen it all before. During the whole of\n",
      "the first act Owen attributed to this his feeling of familiarity with\n",
      "what was going on on the stage. At the beginning of the second act he\n",
      "found himself anticipating events. But it was not till the third act\n",
      "that the truth sank in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third was the only act in which, in his dramatization, he had taken\n",
      "any real liberties with the text of the novel. But in this act he had\n",
      "introduced a character who did not appear in the novel--a creature of\n",
      "his own imagination. And now, with bulging eyes, he observed this\n",
      "creature emerge from the wings, and heard him utter lines which he now\n",
      "clearly remembered having written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey had been right! Serpent Edith Butler had stolen his play.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mind, during the remainder of the play, was active. By the time the\n",
      "final curtain fell and he passed out into the open air he had perceived\n",
      "some of the difficulties of the case. To prove oneself the author of an\n",
      "original play is hard, but not impossible. Friends to whom one had\n",
      "sketched the plot may come forward as witnesses. One may have preserved\n",
      "rough notes. But a dramatization of a novel is another matter. All\n",
      "dramatizations of any given novel must necessarily be very much alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started to walk along Piccadilly, and had reached Hyde Park Corner\n",
      "before he recollected that he had an engagement to take supper with Mr\n",
      "Prosser at the Savoy Hotel. He hailed a cab.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're late,' boomed the author of sociological treatises, as he\n",
      "appeared. 'You're infernally late. I suppose, in your woollen-headed\n",
      "way, you forgot all about it. Come along. We'll just have time for an\n",
      "olive and a glass of something before they turn the lights out.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen was still thinking deeply as he began his supper. Surely there was\n",
      "some way by which he could prove his claims. What had he done with the\n",
      "original manuscript? He remembered now. He had burnt it. It had seemed\n",
      "mere useless litter then. Probably, he felt bitterly, the woman Butler\n",
      "had counted on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Prosser concluded an animated conversation with a waiter on the\n",
      "subject of the wines of France, leaned forward, and, having helped\n",
      "himself briskly to anchovies, began to talk. He talked loudly and\n",
      "rapidly. Owen, his thoughts far away, hardly listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the waiter returned with the selected brand. He filled Owen's\n",
      "glass, and Owen drank, and felt better. Finding his glass magically\n",
      "full once more, he emptied it again. And then suddenly he found himself\n",
      "looking across the table at his Host, and feeling a sense of absolute\n",
      "conviction that this was the one man of all others whom he would have\n",
      "selected as a confidant. How kindly, though somewhat misty, his face\n",
      "was! How soothing, if a little indistinct, his voice!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Prosser,' he said, 'you are a man of the world, and I should like your\n",
      "advice. What would you do in a case like this? I go to a theatre to see\n",
      "a play, and what do I find?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and eyed his host impressively.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's that tune they're playing?' said Mr Prosser. 'You hear it\n",
      "everywhere. One of these Viennese things, I suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen was annoyed. He began to doubt whether, after all, Mr Prosser's\n",
      "virtues as a confidant were not more apparent than real.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I find, by Jove,' he continued, 'that I wrote the thing myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's not a patch on _The Merry Widow_,' said Mr Prosser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen thumped the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I tell you I find I wrote the thing myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What thing?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'This play I'm telling you about. This _White Roses_ thing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He found that he had at last got his host's ear. Mr Prosser seemed\n",
      "genuinely interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you mean?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen plunged on with his story. He started from its dim beginning, from\n",
      "the days when he had bought the novel on his journey from Bath to\n",
      "Cheltenham. He described his methods of work, his registering of the\n",
      "package, his suspense, his growing resignation. He sketched the\n",
      "progress of his life. He spoke of Audrey and gave a crisp\n",
      "character-sketch of Mr Sheppherd. He took his hearer right up to\n",
      "the moment when the truth had come home to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of his narrative the lights went out, and he finished\n",
      "his story in the hotel courtyard. In the cool air he felt revived. The\n",
      "outlines of Mr Prosser became sharp and distinct again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sociologist listened admirably. He appeared absorbed, and did not\n",
      "interrupt once.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What makes you so certain that this was your version?' he asked, as\n",
      "they passed into the Strand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen told him of the creature of his imagination in Act III.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But you have lost your manuscript?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes; I burnt it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Just what one might have expected you to do,' said Mr Prosser,\n",
      "unkindly. 'Young man, I begin to believe that there may be something in\n",
      "this. You haven't got a ghost of a proof that would hold water in a\n",
      "court of law, of course; but still, I'm inclined to believe you. For\n",
      "one thing, you haven't the intelligence to invent such a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen thanked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'In fact, if you can answer me one question I shall be satisfied.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Owen that Mr Prosser was tending to get a little above\n",
      "himself. As an intelligent listener he had been of service, but that\n",
      "appeared to be no reason why he should constitute himself a sort of\n",
      "judge and master of the ceremonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's very good of you,' he said; 'but will Edith Butler be\n",
      "satisfied? That's more to the point.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I _am_ Edith Butler,' said Mr Prosser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen stopped. 'You?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You need not babble it from the house-tops. You are the only person\n",
      "besides my agent who knows it, and I wouldn't have told you if I could\n",
      "have helped it. It isn't a thing I want known. Great Scott, man, don't\n",
      "goggle at me like a fish! Haven't you heard of pseudonyms before?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, but--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, never mind. Take it from me that I _am_ Edith Butler. Now\n",
      "listen to me. That manuscript reached me when I was in the country.\n",
      "There was no name on it. That in itself points strongly to the fact\n",
      "that you were its author. It was precisely the chuckle-headed sort of\n",
      "thing you would have done, to put no name on the thing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I enclosed a letter, anyhow.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There was a letter enclosed. I opened the parcel out of doors. There\n",
      "was a fresh breeze blowing at the time. It caught the letter, and that\n",
      "was the last I saw of it. I had read as far as \"Dear Madam\". But one\n",
      "thing I do remember about it, and that was that it was sent from some\n",
      "hotel in Cheltenham, and I could remember it if I heard it. Now, then?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can tell it you. It was Wilbraham's. I was stopping there.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You pass,' said Mr Prosser. 'It was Wilbraham's.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen's heart gave a jump. For a moment he walked on air.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then do you mean to say that it's all right--that you believe--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do,' said Mr Prosser. 'By the way,' he said, 'the notice of _White\n",
      "Roses_ went up last night.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen's heart turned to lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But--but--' he stammered. 'But tonight the house was packed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was. Packed with paper. All the merry dead-heads in London were\n",
      "there. It has been the worst failure this season. And, by George,' he\n",
      "cried, with sudden vehemence, 'serve 'em right. If I told them once it\n",
      "would fail in England, I told them a hundred times. The London public\n",
      "won't stand that sort of blithering twaddle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen stopped and looked round. A cab was standing across the road. He\n",
      "signalled to it. He felt incapable of walking home. No physical blow\n",
      "could have unmanned him more completely than this hideous\n",
      "disappointment just when, by a miracle, everything seemed to be running\n",
      "his way.\n",
      "\n",

      "of almost eerie versatility in this direction. Time could not wither\n",
      "nor custom stale his infinite variety. He could borrow with a breezy\n",
      "bluffness which made the thing practically a hold-up. And anon, when\n",
      "his victim had steeled himself against this method, he could extract\n",
      "another five-pound note from his little hoard with the delicacy of one\n",

      "he had just made a rather good investment. But released from the spell\n",
      "of his brother-in-law's personal magnetism, Mr Blatherwick was apt to\n",

      "He tore the letter open, and the first thing he saw was a cheque for\n",
      "five pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blatherwick was astounded. That a letter from his brother-in-law\n",

      "The section of it which still worked in the present was just large\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time there was erected in Longacre Square, New York, a\n",
      "large white statue, labelled 'Our City', the figure of a woman in\n",
      "Grecian robes holding aloft a shield. Critical citizens objected to it\n",
      "for various reasons, but its real fault was that its symbolism was\n",
      "faulty. The sculptor should have represented New York as a conjuror in\n",
      "evening dress, smiling blandly as he changed a rabbit into a bowl of\n",
      "goldfish. For that, above all else, is New York's speciality. It\n",
      "changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 1 May, when she stepped off the train, and 16 May, when she\n",
      "received Eddy Moore's letter containing the information that he had\n",
      "found her a post as stenographer in the office of Joe Rendal, it had\n",
      "changed Mary Hill quite remarkably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary was from Dunsterville, which is in Canada. Emigrations from\n",
      "Dunsterville were rare. It is a somnolent town; and, as a rule, young\n",
      "men born there follow in their father's footsteps, working on the\n",
      "paternal farm or helping in the paternal store. Occasionally a daring\n",
      "spirit will break away, but seldom farther than Montreal. Two only of\n",
      "the younger generation, Joe Rendal and Eddy Moore, had set out to make\n",
      "their fortunes in New York; and both, despite the gloomy prophecies of\n",
      "the village sages, had prospered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, third and last emigrant, did not aspire to such heights. All she\n",
      "demanded from New York for the present was that it should pay her a\n",
      "living wage, and to that end, having studied by stealth typewriting and\n",
      "shorthand, she had taken the plunge, thrilling with excitement and the\n",
      "romance of things; and New York had looked at her, raised its eyebrows,\n",
      "and looked away again. If every city has a voice, New York's at that\n",
      "moment had said 'Huh!' This had damped Mary. She saw that there were\n",
      "going to be obstacles. For one thing, she had depended so greatly on\n",
      "Eddy Moore, and he had failed her. Three years before, at a church\n",
      "festival, he had stated specifically that he would die for her. Perhaps\n",
      "he was still willing to do that--she had not inquired--but, at any\n",
      "rate, he did not see his way to employing her as a secretary. He had\n",
      "been very nice about it. He had smiled kindly, taken her address, and\n",
      "said he would do what he could, and had then hurried off to meet a man\n",
      "at lunch. But he had not given her a position. And as the days went by\n",
      "and she found no employment, and her little stock of money dwindled,\n",
      "and no word came from Eddy, New York got to work and changed her\n",
      "outlook on things wonderfully. What had seemed romantic became merely\n",
      "frightening. What had been exciting gave her a feeling of dazed\n",
      "helplessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not until Eddy's letter came that she realized the\n",
      "completeness of the change. On 1 May she would have thanked Eddy\n",
      "politely for his trouble, adding, however, that she would really prefer\n",
      "not to meet poor Joe again. On 16 May she welcomed him as something\n",
      "Heaven-sent. The fact that she was to be employed outweighed a\n",
      "thousand-fold the fact that her employer was to be Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not that she disliked Joe. She was sorry for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered Joe, a silent, shambling youth, all hands, feet, and\n",
      "shyness, who had spent most of his spare time twisting his fingers and\n",
      "staring adoringly at her from afar. The opinion of those in the social\n",
      "whirl of Dunsterville had been that it was his hopeless passion for her\n",
      "that had made him fly to New York. It would be embarrassing meeting him\n",
      "again. It would require tact to discourage his silent worshipping\n",
      "without wounding him more deeply. She hated hurting people.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, even at the cost of that, she must accept the post. To refuse\n",
      "meant ignominious retreat to Dunsterville, and from that her pride\n",
      "revolted. She must revisit Dunsterville in triumph or not at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Rendal's office was in the heart of the financial district,\n",
      "situated about half-way up a building that, to Mary, reared amidst the\n",
      "less impressive architecture of her home-town, seemed to reach nearly\n",
      "to the sky. A proud-looking office-boy, apparently baffled and\n",
      "mortified by the information that she had an appointment, took her\n",
      "name, and she sat down, filled with a fine mixed assortment of\n",
      "emotions, to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time since her arrival in New York she felt almost easy\n",
      "in her mind. New York, with its shoving, jostling, hurrying crowds; a\n",
      "giant fowl-run, full of human fowls scurrying to and fro; clucking,\n",
      "ever on the look-out for some desired morsel, and ever ready to swoop\n",
      "down and snatch it from its temporary possessor, had numbed her. But\n",
      "now she felt a slackening of the strain. New York might be too much for\n",
      "her, but she could cope with Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The haughty boy returned. Mr Rendal was disengaged. She rose and went\n",
      "into an inner room, where a big man was seated at a desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Joe. There was no doubt about that. But it was not the Joe she\n",
      "remembered, he of the twisted ringers and silent stare. In his case,\n",
      "New York had conjured effectively. He was better-looking, better-dressed,\n",
      "improved in every respect. In the old days one had noticed the hands\n",
      "and feet and deduced the presence of Joe somewhere in the background.\n",
      "Now they were merely adjuncts. It was with a rush of indignation that\n",
      "Mary found herself bucolic and awkward. Awkward with Joe! It was an\n",
      "outrage.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manner heightened the feeling. If he had given the least sign of\n",
      "embarrassment she might have softened towards him. He showed no\n",
      "embarrassment whatever. He was very much at his ease. He was cheerful.\n",
      "He was even flippant.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Welcome to our beautiful little city,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary was filled with a helpless anger. What right had he to ignore the\n",
      "past in this way, to behave as if her presence had never reduced him to\n",
      "pulp?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Won't you sit down?' he went on. 'It's splendid, seeing you again,\n",
      "Mary. You're looking very well. How long have you been in New York?\n",
      "Eddy tells me you want to be taken on as a secretary. As it happens,\n",
      "there is a vacancy for just that in this office. A big, wide vacancy,\n",
      "left by a lady who departed yesterday in a shower of burning words and\n",
      "hairpins. She said she would never return, and between ourselves, that\n",
      "was the right guess. Would you mind letting me see what you can do?\n",
      "Will you take this letter down?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly there was something compelling about this new Joe. Mary took\n",
      "the pencil and pad which he offered--and she took them meekly. Until\n",
      "this moment she had always been astonished by the reports which\n",
      "filtered through to Dunsterville of his success in the big city. Of\n",
      "course, nobody had ever doubted his perseverance; but it takes\n",
      "something more than perseverance to fight New York fairly and squarely,\n",
      "and win. And Joe had that something. He had force. He was sure of\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Read it please,' he said, when he had finished dictating. 'Yes, that's\n",
      "all right. You'll do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Mary was on the point of refusing. A mad desire gripped\n",
      "her to assert herself, to make plain her resentment at this revolt of\n",
      "the serf. Then she thought of those scuttling, clucking crowds, and her\n",
      "heart failed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thank you,' she said, in a small voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke the door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, well, well!' said Joe. 'Here we all are! Come in, Eddy. Mary\n",
      "has just been showing me what she can do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "If time had done much for Joe, it had done more for his fellow-emigrant,\n",
      "Eddy Moore. He had always been good-looking and--according to local\n",
      "standards--presentable. Tall, slim, with dark eyes that made you catch\n",
      "your breath when they looked into yours, and a ready flow of speech,\n",
      "he had been Dunsterville's prize exhibit. And here he was with all his\n",
      "excellence heightened and accentuated by the polish of the city. He\n",
      "had filled out. His clothes were wonderful. And his voice, when he\n",
      "spoke, had just that same musical quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "'So you and Joe have fixed it up? Capital! Shall we all go and lunch\n",
      "somewhere?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Got an appointment,' said Joe. 'I'm late already. Be here at two\n",
      "sharp, Mary.' He took up his hat and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of Eddy's suavity had been to make Mary forget the position\n",
      "in which she now stood to Joe. Eddy had created for the moment quite an\n",
      "old-time atmosphere of good fellowship. She hated Joe for shattering\n",
      "this and reminding her that she was his employee. Her quick flush was\n",
      "not lost on Eddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Dear old Joe is a little abrupt sometimes,' he said. 'But--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He's a pig!' said Mary, defiantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But you mustn't mind it. New York makes men like that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It hasn't made you--not to me, at any rate. Oh, Eddy,' she cried,\n",
      "impulsively, 'I'm frightened. I wish I had never come here. You're the\n",
      "only thing in this whole city that isn't hateful.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Poor little girl!' he said. 'Never mind. Let me take you and give you\n",
      "some lunch. Come along.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Eddy was soothing. There was no doubt of that. He stayed her with\n",
      "minced chicken and comforted her with soft shelled crab. His voice was\n",
      "a lullaby, lulling her Joe-harassed nerves to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "They discussed the dear old days. A carper might have said that Eddy\n",
      "was the least bit vague on the subject of the dear old days. A carper\n",
      "might have pointed out that the discussion of the dear old days, when\n",
      "you came to analyse it, was practically a monologue on Mary's part,\n",
      "punctuated with musical 'Yes, yes's' from her companion. But who cares\n",
      "what carpers think? Mary herself had no fault to find. In the roar of\n",
      "New York Dunsterville had suddenly become very dear to her, and she\n",
      "found in Eddy a sympathetic soul to whom she could open her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you remember the old school, Eddy, and how you and I used to walk\n",
      "there together, you carrying my dinner-basket and helping me over\n",

      "'Yes, yes.'\n",

      "the well in that old wooden bucket in the winter, and pouring it out in\n",
      "the playground and skating on it when it froze? And wasn't it cold in\n",

      "member of the little band grouped under the banner of J. Rendal as a\n",

      "changed. Without a word spoken on either side it seemed that peace had\n",

      "awkwardness in the struggle for success in New York. His words, his\n",
      "manner--everything had pointed to that. And now--it was as if those\n",

      "\n",
      "Had she altered? Her mind was in a whirl. This thing had affected her like\n",

      "that was strange to her. He smiled, but it seemed to Mary that there\n",

      "\n",
      "'Of course we have, Eddy,' she said. He touched her hand.\n",

      "He touched her hand again. This time, somehow, the action grated on\n",
      "her. Before, it had seemed impulsive, a mere spontaneous evidence\n",
      "of friendship. Now there was a suggestion of artificiality,--of\n",
      "calculation. She drew back a little in her chair. Deep down in her\n",
      "some watchful instinct had sounded an alarm. She was on guard.\n",
      "\n",

      "him. The silky blueness of the sea was startling. The pure white of the\n",
      "great hotels along the promenade and the Casino Municipale fascinated\n",
      "him. He was dazzled. At the Casino the pillars were crimson and cream,\n",
      "the tables sky-blue and pink. Seated on a green-and-white striped chair\n",

      "little limited.\n",
      "\n",

      "acknowledgement in reply to her thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five vast bloomers in under a minute! What could she have thought of\n",

      "itself in a mossy bank could have had a greater distaste for scenes.\n",
      "But tonight he was not normal. Roville and its colour had wrought a\n",
      "sort of fever in his brain. _Boule_ had increased it. And love had\n",
      "caused it to rage. If this had been entirely his own affair it is\n",
      "probable that the croupier's frigid calm would have quelled him and he\n",
      "would have retired, fermenting but baffled. But it was not his own\n",
      "affair. He was fighting the cause of the only girl in the world. She\n",
      "had trusted him. Could he fail her? No, he was dashed if he could. He\n",
      "would show her what he was made of. His heart swelled within him. A\n",
      "thrill permeated his entire being, starting at his head and running out\n",
      "at his heels. He felt tremendous--a sort of blend of Oliver Cromwell, a\n",
      "Berserk warrior, and Sir Galahad.\n",

      "Finished, was it? All right, now he would show them. They had asked for\n",

      "It is a remarkable fact in life that the scenes which we have rehearsed\n",

      "present case, for instance, it had been George's intention to handle\n",
      "the subsequent stages of this little dispute with an easy dignity. He\n",
      "had proposed, the money obtained, to hand it over to its rightful\n",
      "owner, raise his hat, and retire with an air, a gallant champion of the\n",
      "oppressed. It was probably about one-sixteenth of a second after his\n",
      "hand had closed on the coins that he realized in the most vivid manner\n",
      "that these were not the lines on which the incident was to develop,\n",
      "and, with all his heart, he congratulated himself on having discarded\n",
      "those brown boots in favour of a worn but roomy pair of gent's Oxfords.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment,\n",
      "while the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted\n",
      "themselves to the marvel, and then the world became full of starting\n",
      "eyes, yelling throats, and clutching hands. From all over the casino\n",
      "fresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of\n",
      "things. Promenaders ceased to promenade, waiters to wait. Elderly\n",
      "gentlemen sprang on to tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in that momentary pause George had got off the mark. The table at\n",
      "which he had been standing was the one nearest to the door, and he had\n",
      "been on the door side of it. As the first eyes began to start, the\n",
      "first throats to yell, and the first hands to clutch, he was passing\n",
      "the counter of the money-changer. He charged the swing-door at full\n",
      "speed, and, true to its mission, it swung. He had a vague glimpse from\n",
      "the corner of his eye of the hat-and-cloak counter, and then he was in\n",
      "the square with the cold night breeze blowing on his forehead and the\n",
      "stars winking down from the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "A paper-seller on the pavement, ever the man of business, stepped\n",
      "forward and offered him the Paris edition of the _Daily Mail_,\n",
      "and, being in the direct line of transit, shot swiftly into the road\n",
      "and fell into a heap, while George, shaken but going well, turned off\n",
      "to the left, where there seemed to be rather more darkness than\n",
      "anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the casino disgorged the pursuers.\n",
      "\n",
      "To George, looking hastily over his shoulder, there seemed a thousand\n",
      "of them. The square rang with their cries. He could not understand\n",
      "them, but gathered that they were uncomplimentary. At any rate, they\n",
      "stimulated a little man in evening dress strolling along the pavement\n",
      "towards him, to become suddenly animated and to leap from side to side\n",
      "with outstretched arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Panic makes Harlequin three-quarters of us all. For one who had never\n",
      "played Rugby football George handled the situation well. He drew the\n",
      "defence with a feint to the left, then, swerving to the right, shot\n",
      "past into the friendly darkness. From behind came the ringing of feet\n",
      "and an evergrowing din.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is one of the few compensations a fugitive pursued by a crowd enjoys\n",
      "that, while he has space for his manoeuvres, those who pursue are\n",
      "hampered by their numbers. In the little regiment that pounded at his\n",
      "heels it is probable that there were many faster runners than George.\n",
      "On the other hand, there were many slower, and in the early stages of\n",
      "the chase these impeded their swifter brethren. At the end of the first\n",
      "half-minute, therefore, George, not sparing himself, had drawn well\n",
      "ahead, and for the first time found leisure for connected thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "His brain became preternaturally alert, so that when, rounding a\n",
      "corner, he perceived entering the main road from a side-street in front\n",
      "of him a small knot of pedestrians, he did not waver, but was seized\n",
      "with a keen spasm of presence of mind. Without pausing in his stride,\n",
      "he pointed excitedly before him, and at the same moment shouted the\n",
      "words, '_La! La! Vite! Vite!_'\n",
      "\n",
      "His stock of French was small, but it ran to that, and for his purpose\n",
      "it was ample. The French temperament is not stolid. When the French\n",
      "temperament sees a man running rapidly and pointing into the middle\n",
      "distance and hears him shouting, '_La! La! Vite! Vite!_' it does\n",
      "not stop to make formal inquiries. It sprints like a mustang. It did so\n",
      "now, with the happy result that a moment later George was racing down\n",
      "the road, the centre and recognized leader of an enthusiastic band of\n",
      "six, which, in the next twenty yards, swelled to eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes later, in a wine-shop near the harbour, he was sipping the\n",
      "first glass of a bottle of cheap but comforting _vin ordinaire_\n",
      "while he explained to the interested proprietor, by means of a mixture\n",
      "of English, broken French, and gestures that he had been helping to\n",
      "chase a thief, but had been forced by fatigue to retire prematurely for\n",
      "refreshment. The proprietor gathered, however, that he had every\n",
      "confidence in the zeal of his still active colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is convincing evidence of the extent to which love had triumphed\n",
      "over prudence in George's soul that the advisability of lying hid in\n",
      "his hotel on the following day did not even cross his mind. Immediately\n",
      "after breakfast, or what passed for it at Roville, he set out for the\n",
      "Hotel Cercle de la Mediterranee to hand over the two louis to their\n",
      "owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Julia, he was informed on arrival, was out. The porter, politely\n",

      "\n",
      "'Good morning,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not seen him coming, and she started at his voice. The flush\n",
      "was back on her face as she turned to him. There was a look of\n",
      "astonishment in the grey eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He held out the two louis.\n",
      "\n",

      "with your winnings for good! The croupier wouldn't give them up, you\n",
      "know, so I had to grab them and run. They came to exactly two louis.\n",

      "An elderly lady seated on the bench, who had loomed from behind a\n",

      "speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who is this young man?'\n",
      "\n",
      "George looked at her, startled. He had hardly been aware of her\n",

      "looked more like an aunt. Of course, it must seem odd to her, his\n",
      "charging in like this, a perfect stranger, and beginning to chat with\n",

      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I met your--this young lady'--something told him that was not the\n",

      "casino last night.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped. The effect of his words on the elderly lady was remarkable.\n",
      "Her face seemed to turn to stone and become all sharp points. She\n",

      "\n",

      "lit up. She leaned back in the seat and began to laugh, softly at\n",
      "first, and then with a note that jarred on George. Whatever the humour\n",
      "of the situation--and he had not detected it at present--this mirth, he\n",
      "felt, was unnatural and excessive.\n",
      "\n",
      "She checked herself at length, and a flush crept over her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know why I did that,' she said, abruptly. 'I'm sorry. There\n",
      "was nothing funny in what you said. But I'm not Lady Julia, and I have\n",
      "no mother. That was Lady Julia who has just gone, and I am nothing more\n",

      "\n",
      "'Her companion!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I had better say her late companion. It will soon be that. I had\n",

      "or sat in meditative silence in deep arm-chairs. Sometimes the visitor\n",
      "felt that he was in a cathedral, sometimes in a Turkish bath; while now\n",
      "and then there was a suggestion of the waiting-room of a more than\n",
      "usually prosperous dentist. It was magnificent, but not exhilarating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rollo was shown into the smoking-room, where his uncle received him.\n",
      "There was a good deal of Mr Andrew Galloway. Grief, gnawing at his\n",
      "heart, had not sagged his ample waistcoat, which preceded him as he\n",
      "moved in much the same manner as Birnam Woods preceded the army of\n",
      "Macduff. A well-nourished hand crept round the corner of the edifice\n",
      "and enveloped Rollo's in a powerful grip.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, my boy!' bellowed Mr Galloway cheerfully. His voice was always\n",
      "loud. 'Glad you've come.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be absurd to say that Rollo looked at his uncle keenly. He was\n",
      "not capable of looking keenly at anyone. But certainly a puzzled\n",
      "expression came into his face. Whether it was the heartiness of the\n",
      "other's hand-shake or the unusual cheeriness of his voice, he could not\n",
      "say; but something gave him the impression that a curious change had\n",
      "come over the Braces King. When they had met before during the last few\n",
      "years Mr Galloway had been practically sixteen stone five of blood and\n",
      "iron--one of those stern, soured men. His attitude had been that of one\n",
      "for whom Life's music had ceased. Had he then inserted another record?\n",
      "His manner conveyed that idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustained thought always gave Rollo a headache. He ceased to speculate.\n",
      "\n",

      "fellow. I always like dining here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Here!' Mr Galloway surveyed the somnolent occupants of the room with\n",
      "spirited scorn. 'We aren't going to dine in this forsaken old\n",
      "mausoleum. I've sent in my resignation today. If I find myself wanting\n",
      "this sort of thing at any time, I'll go to Paris and hunt up the\n",
      "Morgue. Bunch of old dead-beats! Bah! I've engaged a table at Romano's.\n",
      "That's more in my line. Get your coat, and let's be going.'\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cab Rollo risked the headache. At whatever cost this thing must\n",
      "be pondered over. His uncle prattled gaily throughout the journey. Once\n",
      "he whooped--some weird, forgotten college yell, dragged from the misty\n",
      "depths of the past. It was passing strange. And in this unusual manner\n",
      "the two rolled into the Strand, and drew up at Romano's door.\n",

      "Mr Galloway was a good trencherman. At a very early date he had\n",
      "realized that a man who wishes to make satisfactory braces must keep\n",
      "his strength up. He wanted a good deal here below, and he wanted it\n",
      "warm and well cooked. It was, therefore, not immediately that his\n",
      "dinner with Rollo became a feast of reason and a flow of soul. Indeed,\n",
      "the two revellers had lighted their cigars before the elder gave forth\n",
      "any remark that was not purely gastronomic.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he did jerk the conversation up on to a higher plane, he jerked it\n",
      "hard. He sent it shooting into the realms of the soulful with a whiz.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Rollo,' he said, blowing a smoke-ring, 'do you believe in affinities?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Rollo, in the act of sipping a liqueur brandy, lowered his glass in\n",
      "surprise. His head was singing slightly as the result of some rather\n",
      "spirited Bollinger (extra sec), and he wondered if he had heard aright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Galloway continued, his voice rising as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My boy,' he said, 'I feel young tonight for the first time in years.\n",
      "And, hang it, I'm not so old! Men have married at twice my age.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Strictly speaking, this was incorrect, unless one counted Methuselah;\n",
      "but perhaps Mr Galloway spoke figuratively.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Three times my age,' he proceeded, leaning back and blowing smoke,\n",
      "thereby missing his nephew's agitated start. 'Four times my age. Five\n",
      "times my age. Six--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled himself together in some confusion. A generous wine, that\n",
      "Bollinger. He must be careful.\n",
      "\n",
      "He coughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you--you aren't--are you--' Rollo paused. 'Are you thinking of\n",
      "getting married, uncle?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Galloway's gaze was still on the ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A great deal of nonsense,' he yelled severely, 'is talked about men\n",
      "lowering themselves by marrying actresses. I was a guest at a\n",
      "supper-party last night at which an actress was present. And a more\n",
      "charming, sensible girl I never wish to meet. Not one of your silly,\n",
      "brainless chits who don't know the difference between lobster Newburg\n",
      "and canvas-back duck, and who prefer sweet champagne to dry. No, sir!\n",
      "Not one of your mincing, affected kind who pretend they never touch\n",
      "anything except a spoonful of cold _consomme_. No, sir! Good, healthy\n",
      "appetite. Enjoyed her food, and knew why she was enjoying it. I give\n",
      "you my word, my boy, until I met her I didn't know a woman existed who\n",

      "wrathfully, 'because, forsooth, she earns an honest living by singing\n",
      "in the chorus of a comic opera, a whole bunch of snivelling idiots will\n",

      "Galloway is not the man to--to--is not the man--' He stopped. 'Well,\n",
      "anyway, I'll show them,' he concluded rather lamely.\n",

      "Rollo eyed him with fallen jaw. His liqueur had turned to wormwood. He\n",
      "had been fearing this for years. You may drive out Nature with a\n",
      "pitchfork, but she will return. Blood will tell. Once a Pittsburgh\n",
      "millionaire, always a Pittsburgh millionaire. For eleven years his\n",
      "uncle had fought against his natural propensities, with apparent\n",
      "success; but Nature had won in the end. His words could have no other\n",
      "meaning. Andrew Galloway was going to marry a chorus-girl.\n",

      "A TALE OF KING ARTHUR'S ROUND TABLE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time ago, when spending a delightful week-end at the ancestral\n",
      "castle of my dear old friend, the Duke of Weatherstonhope (pronounced\n",
      "Wop), I came across an old black-letter MS. It is on this that the\n",
      "story which follows is based.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found it necessary to touch the thing up a little here and\n",
      "there, for writers in those days were weak in construction. Their idea\n",
      "of telling a story was to take a long breath and start droning away\n",
      "without any stops or dialogue till the thing was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also condensed the title. In the original it ran, '\"How it came\n",
      "about that ye good Knight Sir Agravaine ye Dolorous of ye Table Round\n",
      "did fare forth to succour a damsel in distress and after divers\n",
      "journeyings and perils by flood and by field did win her for his bride\n",
      "and right happily did they twain live ever afterwards,\" by Ambrose ye\n",
      "monk.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pretty snappy title for those days, but we have such a high\n",
      "standard in titles nowadays that I have felt compelled to omit a few\n",
      "yards of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may now proceed to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The great tournament was in full swing. All through the afternoon\n",
      "boiler-plated knights on mettlesome chargers had hurled themselves on\n",
      "each other's spears, to the vast contentment of all. Bright eyes shone;\n",
      "handkerchiefs fluttered; musical voices urged chosen champions to knock\n",
      "the cover off their brawny adversaries. The cheap seats had long since\n",
      "become hoarse with emotion. All round the arena rose the cries of\n",
      "itinerant merchants: 'Iced malvoisie,' 'Score-cards; ye cannot tell the\n",
      "jousters without a score-card.' All was revelry and excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hush fell on the throng. From either end of the arena a mounted\n",
      "knight in armour had entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The herald raised his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ladeez'n gemmen! Battling Galahad and Agravaine the Dolorous. Galahad\n",
      "on my right, Agravaine on my left. Squires out of the ring. Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "A speculator among the crowd offered six to one on Galahad, but found\n",
      "no takers. Nor was the public's caution without reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment later the two had met in a cloud of dust, and Agravaine,\n",
      "shooting over his horse's crupper, had fallen with a metallic clang.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked himself up, and limped slowly from the arena. He was not\n",
      "unused to this sort of thing. Indeed, nothing else had happened to him\n",
      "in his whole jousting career.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was that Sir Agravaine the Dolorous was out of his element at\n",
      "King Arthur's court, and he knew it. It was this knowledge that had\n",
      "given him that settled air of melancholy from which he derived his\n",
      "title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until I came upon this black-letter MS. I had been under the\n",
      "impression, like, I presume, everybody else, that every Knight of the\n",
      "Round Table was a model of physical strength and beauty. Malory says\n",
      "nothing to suggest the contrary. Nor does Tennyson. But apparently\n",
      "there were exceptions, of whom Sir Agravaine the Dolorous must have\n",
      "been the chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, it seems, nothing to mitigate this unfortunate man's\n",
      "physical deficiencies. There is a place in the world for the strong,\n",
      "ugly man, and there is a place for the weak, handsome man. But to fall\n",
      "short both in features and in muscle is to stake your all on brain. And\n",
      "in the days of King Arthur you did not find the populace turning out to\n",
      "do homage to brain. It was a drug on the market. Agravaine was a good\n",
      "deal better equipped than his contemporaries with grey matter, but his\n",
      "height in his socks was but five feet four; and his muscles, though he\n",
      "had taken three correspondence courses in physical culture, remained\n",
      "distressingly flaccid. His eyes were pale and mild, his nose snub, and\n",
      "his chin receded sharply from his lower lip, as if Nature, designing\n",
      "him, had had to leave off in a hurry and finish the job anyhow. The\n",
      "upper teeth, protruding, completed the resemblance to a nervous rabbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handicapped in this manner, it is no wonder that he should feel sad and\n",
      "lonely in King Arthur's court. At heart he ached for romance; but\n",
      "romance passed him by. The ladies of the court ignored his existence,\n",
      "while, as for those wandering damsels who came periodically to Camelot\n",
      "to complain of the behaviour of dragons, giants, and the like, and to\n",
      "ask permission of the king to take a knight back with them to fight\n",
      "their cause (just as, nowadays, one goes out and calls a policeman), he\n",
      "simply had no chance. The choice always fell on Lancelot or some other\n",
      "popular favourite.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tournament was followed by a feast. In those brave days almost\n",
      "everything was followed by a feast. The scene was gay and animated.\n",
      "Fair ladies, brave knights, churls, varlets, squires, scurvy knaves,\n",
      "men-at-arms, malapert rogues--all were merry. All save Agravaine. He\n",
      "sat silent and moody. To the jests of Dagonet he turned a deaf ear. And\n",
      "when his neighbour, Sir Kay, arguing with Sir Percivale on current\n",
      "form, appealed to him to back up his statement that Sir Gawain, though\n",
      "a workman-like middle-weight, lacked the punch, he did not answer,\n",
      "though the subject was one on which he held strong views. He sat on,\n",
      "brooding.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he sat there, a man-at-arms entered the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your majesty,' he cried, 'a damsel in distress waits without.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of excitement and interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Show her in,' said the king, beaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man-at-arms retired. Around the table the knights were struggling\n",
      "into an upright position in their seats and twirling their moustaches.\n",
      "Agravaine alone made no movement. He had been through this sort of\n",
      "thing so often. What were distressed damsels to him? His whole\n",
      "demeanour said, as plainly as if he had spoken the words, 'What's the\n",
      "use?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd at the door parted, and through the opening came a figure at\n",
      "the sight of whom the expectant faces of the knights turned pale with\n",
      "consternation. For the new-comer was quite the plainest girl those\n",
      "stately halls had ever seen. Possibly the only plain girl they had ever\n",
      "seen, for no instance is recorded in our authorities of the existence\n",
      "at that period of any such.\n",
      "\n",
      "The knights gazed at her blankly. Those were the grand old days of\n",
      "chivalry, when a thousand swords would leap from their scabbards to\n",
      "protect defenceless woman, if she were beautiful. The present seemed\n",
      "something in the nature of a special case, and nobody was quite certain\n",
      "as to the correct procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "An awkward silence was broken by the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Er--yes?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damsel halted.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your majesty,' she cried, 'I am in distress. I crave help!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Just so,' said the king, uneasily, flashing an apprehensive glance at\n",
      "the rows of perturbed faces before him. 'Just _so_. What--er--what is\n",
      "the exact nature of the--ah--trouble? Any assistance these gallant\n",
      "knights can render will, I am sure, be--ah--eagerly rendered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked imploringly at the silent warriors. As a rule, this speech\n",
      "was the signal for roars of applause. But now there was not even a\n",
      "murmur.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I may say enthusiastically,' he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Precisely,' said the king, ever tactful. 'And now--you were saying?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am Yvonne, the daughter of Earl Dorm of the Hills,' said the damsel,\n",
      "'and my father has sent me to ask protection from a gallant knight\n",
      "against a fiery dragon that ravages the country-side.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A dragon, gentlemen,' said the king, aside. It was usually a safe\n",
      "draw. Nothing pleased the knight of that time more than a brisk bout\n",
      "with a dragon. But now the tempting word was received in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fiery,' said the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some more silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king had recourse to the direct appeal. 'Sir Gawain, this Court\n",
      "would be greatly indebted to you if--'\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Gawain said he had strained a muscle at the last tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sir Pelleas.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The king's voice was growing flat with consternation. The situation was\n",
      "unprecedented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Pelleas said he had an ingrowing toe-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king's eye rolled in anguish around the table. Suddenly it stopped.\n",
      "It brightened. His look of dismay changed to one of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "A knight had risen to his feet. It was Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah!' said the king, drawing a deep breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Agravaine gulped. He was feeling more nervous than he had ever felt\n",
      "in his life. Never before had he risen to volunteer his services in a\n",
      "matter of this kind, and his state of mind was that of a small boy\n",
      "about to recite his first piece of poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not only the consciousness that every eye, except one of Sir\n",
      "Balin's which had been closed in the tournament that afternoon, was\n",
      "upon him. What made him feel like a mild gentleman in a post-office who\n",
      "has asked the lady assistant if she will have time to attend to him\n",
      "soon and has caught her eye, was the fact that he thought he had\n",
      "observed the damsel Yvonne frown as he rose. He groaned in spirit. This\n",
      "damsel, he felt, wanted the proper goods or none at all. She might not\n",
      "be able to get Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad; but she was not going to be\n",
      "satisfied with a half-portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact was that Sir Agravaine had fallen in love at first sight. The\n",
      "moment he had caught a glimpse of the damsel Yvonne, he loved her\n",
      "devotedly. To others she seemed plain and unattractive. To him she was\n",
      "a Queen of Beauty. He was amazed at the inexplicable attitude of the\n",
      "knights around him. He had expected them to rise in a body to clamour\n",
      "for the chance of assisting this radiant vision. He could hardly\n",
      "believe, even now, that he was positively the only starter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This is Sir Agravaine the Dolorous,' said the king to the damsel.\n",
      "'Will you take him as your champion?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine held his breath. But all was well. The damsel bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then, Sir Agravaine,' said the king, 'perhaps you had better have your\n",
      "charger sent round at once. I imagine that the matter is pressing--time\n",
      "and--er--dragons wait for no man.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes later Agravaine, still dazed, was jogging along to the\n",

      "It was some time before either of them spoke. The damsel seemed\n",
      "preoccupied, and Agravaine's mind was a welter of confused thoughts,\n",
      "the most prominent of which and the one to which he kept returning\n",
      "being the startling reflection that he, who had pined for romance so\n",
      "long, had got it now in full measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dragon! Fiery withal. Was he absolutely certain that he was capable\n",
      "of handling an argument with a fiery dragon? He would have given much\n",
      "for a little previous experience of this sort of thing. It was too late\n",
      "now, but he wished he had had the forethought to get Merlin to put up a\n",
      "magic prescription for him, rendering him immune to dragon-bites. But\n",
      "did dragons bite? Or did they whack at you with their tails? Or just\n",
      "blow fire?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a dozen such points that he would have liked to have settled\n",
      "before starting. It was silly to start out on a venture of this sort\n",
      "without special knowledge. He had half a mind to plead a forgotten\n",
      "engagement and go straight back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked at the damsel, and his mind was made up. What did death\n",
      "matter if he could serve her?\n",
      "\n",
      "He coughed. She came out of her reverie with a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This dragon, now?' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the damsel did not reply. 'A fearsome worm, Sir Knight,'\n",
      "she said at length. 'It raveneth by day and by night. It breathes fire\n",
      "from its nostrils.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Does it!' said Agravaine. '_Does_ it! You couldn't give some\n",
      "idea what it looks like, what kind of _size_ it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Its body is as thick as ten stout trees, and its head touches the\n",
      "clouds.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Does it!' said Agravaine thoughtfully. '_Does_ it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, Sir Knight, I pray you have a care.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will,' said Agravaine. And he had seldom said anything more\n",
      "fervently. The future looked about as bad as it could be. Any hopes\n",
      "he may have entertained that this dragon might turn out to\n",
      "be comparatively small and inoffensive were dissipated. This was\n",
      "plainly no debilitated wreck of a dragon, its growth stunted by\n",
      "excessive-fire-breathing. A body as thick as ten stout trees! He would\n",
      "not even have the melancholy satisfaction of giving the creature\n",
      "indigestion. For all the impression he was likely to make on that vast\n",
      "interior, he might as well be a salted almond.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were speaking, a dim mass on the skyline began to take shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Behold!' said the damsel. 'My father's castle.' And presently they\n",
      "were riding across the drawbridge and through the great gate, which\n",
      "shut behind them with a clang.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they dismounted a man came out through a door at the farther end of\n",
      "the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",

      "Earl Dorm of the Hills, was a small, elderly man, with what Agravaine\n",
      "considered a distinctly furtive air about him. His eyes were too close\n",
      "together, and he was over-lavish with a weak, cunning smile. Even\n",
      "Agravaine, who was in the mood to like the whole family, if possible,\n",
      "for Yvonne's sake, could not help feeling that appearances were against\n",
      "this particular exhibit. He might have a heart of gold beneath the\n",
      "outward aspect of a confidence-trick expert whose hobby was dog-stealing,\n",
      "but there was no doubt that his exterior did not inspire a genial glow\n",
      "of confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very good of you to come,' said the earl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a pleasure,' said Agravaine. 'I have been hearing all about the\n",
      "dragon.'\n",
      "\n",

      "after dinner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the custom in those days in the stately homes of England for the\n",
      "whole strength of the company to take their meals together. The guests\n",
      "sat at the upper table, the ladies in a gallery above them, while the\n",
      "usual drove of men-at-arms, archers, malapert rogues, varlets, scurvy\n",
      "knaves, scullions, and plug-uglies attached to all medieval households,\n",
      "squashed in near the door, wherever they could find room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retinue of Earl Dorm was not strong numerically--the household\n",
      "being, to judge from appearances, one that had seen better days; but it\n",
      "struck Agravaine that what it lacked in numbers it made up in\n",
      "toughness. Among all those at the bottom of the room there was not one\n",
      "whom it would have been agreeable to meet alone in a dark alley. Of\n",
      "all those foreheads not one achieved a height of more than one point\n",
      "nought four inches. A sinister collection, indeed, and one which,\n",
      "Agravaine felt, should have been capable of handling without his\n",
      "assistance any dragon that ever came into the world to stimulate the\n",
      "asbestos industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was roused from his reflections by the voice of his host.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I hope you are not tired after your journey, Sir Agravaine? My little\n",
      "girl did not bore you, I trust? We are very quiet folk here. Country\n",
      "mice. But we must try to make your visit interesting.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine felt that the dragon might be counted upon to do that. He\n",
      "said as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, yes, the dragon,' said Earl Dorm, 'I was forgetting the dragon. I\n",
      "want to have a long talk with you about that dragon. Not now. Later\n",
      "on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His eye caught Agravaine's, and he smiled that weak, cunning smile of\n",
      "his. And for the first time the knight was conscious of a curious\n",
      "feeling that all was not square and aboveboard in this castle. A\n",
      "conviction began to steal over him that in some way he was being played\n",
      "with, that some game was afoot which he did not understand, that--in a\n",
      "word--there was dirty work at the cross-roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a touch of mystery in the atmosphere which made him vaguely\n",
      "uneasy. When a fiery dragon is ravaging the country-side to such an\n",
      "extent that the S.O.S. call has been sent out to the Round Table, a\n",
      "knight has a right to expect the monster to be the main theme of\n",
      "conversation. The tendency on his host's part was apparently to avoid\n",
      "touching on the subject at all. He was vague and elusive; and the one\n",
      "topic on which an honest man is not vague and elusive is that of fiery\n",
      "dragons. It was not right. It was as if one should phone for the police\n",
      "and engage them, on arrival, in a discussion on the day's football\n",
      "results.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wave of distrust swept over Agravaine. He had heard stories of robber\n",
      "chiefs who lured strangers into their strongholds and then held them\n",
      "prisoners while the public nervously dodged their anxious friends who\n",
      "had formed subscription lists to make up the ransom. Could this be such\n",
      "a case? The man certainly had an evasive manner and a smile which would\n",
      "have justified any jury in returning a verdict without leaving the box.\n",
      "On the other hand, there was Yvonne. His reason revolted against the\n",
      "idea of that sweet girl being a party to any such conspiracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, probably it was only the Earl's unfortunate manner. Perhaps he\n",
      "suffered from some muscular weakness of the face which made him smile\n",
      "like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he certainly wished that he had not allowed himself to be\n",
      "deprived of his sword and armour. At the time it had seemed to him that\n",
      "the Earl's remark that the latter needed polishing and the former\n",
      "stropping betrayed only a kindly consideration for his guest's well-being.\n",
      "Now, it had the aspect of being part of a carefully-constructed plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand--here philosophy came to his rescue--if anybody did\n",
      "mean to start anything, his sword and armour might just as well not be\n",
      "there. Any one of those mammoth low-brows at the door could eat him,\n",
      "armour and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He resumed his meal, uneasy but resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner at Earl Dorm's was no lunch-counter scuffle. It started early\n",
      "and finished late. It was not till an advanced hour that Agravaine was\n",
      "conducted to his room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room which had been allotted to him was high up in the eastern\n",
      "tower. It was a nice room, but to one in Agravaine's state of\n",
      "suppressed suspicion a trifle too solidly upholstered. The door was of\n",
      "the thickest oak, studded with iron nails. Iron bars formed a neat\n",
      "pattern across the only window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had Agravaine observed these things when the door opened, and\n",
      "before him stood the damsel Yvonne, pale of face and panting for\n",
      "breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned against the doorpost and gulped.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fly!' she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reader, if you had come to spend the night in the lonely castle of a\n",
      "perfect stranger with a shifty eye and a rogues' gallery smile, and on\n",
      "retiring to your room had found the door kick-proof and the window\n",
      "barred, and if, immediately after your discovery of these phenomena, a\n",
      "white-faced young lady had plunged in upon you and urged you to\n",
      "immediate flight, wouldn't that jar you?\n",
      "\n",
      "It jarred Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Eh?' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fly! Fly, Sir Knight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Another footstep sounded in the passage. The damsel gave a startled\n",
      "look over her shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And what's all this?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Earl Dorm appeared in the dim-lit corridor. His voice had a nasty\n",
      "tinkle in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your--your daughter,' said Agravaine, hurriedly, 'was just telling me\n",
      "that breakfast would--'\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentence remained unfinished. A sudden movement of the earl's hand,\n",
      "and the great door banged in his face. There came the sound of a bolt\n",
      "shooting into its socket. A key turned in the lock. He was trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, the earl had seized his daughter by the wrist and was\n",
      "administering a paternal cross-examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What were you saying to him?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yvonne did not flinch.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was bidding him fly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If he wants to leave this castle,' said the earl, grimly, 'he'll have\n",
      "to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father,' said Yvonne,' I can't.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can't what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His grip on her wrist tightened. From the other side of the door came\n",
      "the muffled sound of blows on the solid oak. 'Oh?' said Earl Dorm.\n",
      "'You can't, eh? Well, listen to me. You've got to. Do you understand? I\n",
      "admit he might be better-looking, but--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father, I love him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He released her wrist, and stared at her in the uncertain light.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You love him!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then what--? Why? Well, I never did understand women,' he said at\n",
      "last, and stumped off down the passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this cryptic conversation was in progress, Agravaine, his worst\n",
      "apprehensions realized, was trying to batter down the door. After a few\n",
      "moments, however, he realized the futility of his efforts, and sat down\n",
      "on the bed to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the risk of forfeiting the reader's respect, it must be admitted\n",
      "that his first emotion was one of profound relief. If he was locked up\n",
      "like this, it must mean that that dragon story was fictitious, and that\n",
      "all danger was at an end of having to pit his inexperience against a\n",
      "ravening monster who had spent a lifetime devouring knights. He had\n",
      "never liked the prospect, though he had been prepared to go through\n",
      "with it, and to feel that it was definitely cancelled made up for a\n",
      "good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mind next turned to his immediate future. What were they going to\n",
      "do with him? On this point he felt tolerably comfortable. This\n",
      "imprisonment could mean nothing more than that he would be compelled to\n",
      "disgorge a ransom. This did not trouble him. He was rich, and, now that\n",
      "the situation had been switched to a purely business basis, he felt\n",
      "that he could handle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, there was nothing to be gained by sitting up, so he went\n",
      "to bed, like a good philosopher.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was pouring through the barred window when he was awoken by the\n",
      "entrance of a gigantic figure bearing food and drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recognized him as one of the scurvy knaves who had dined at the\n",
      "bottom of the room the night before--a vast, beetle-browed fellow with\n",
      "a squint, a mop of red hair, and a genius for silence. To Agravaine's\n",
      "attempts to engage him in conversation he replied only with grunts, and\n",
      "in a short time left the room, closing and locking the door behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was succeeded at dusk by another of about the same size and\n",
      "ugliness, and with even less conversational _elan_. This one did\n",
      "not even grunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-talk, it seemed, was not an art cultivated in any great measure\n",
      "by the lower orders in the employment of Earl Dorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day passed without incident. In the morning the strabismic\n",
      "plug-ugly with the red hair brought him food and drink, while in the\n",
      "evening the non-grunter did the honours. It was a peaceful life, but\n",
      "tending towards monotony, and Agravaine was soon in the frame of mind\n",
      "which welcomes any break in the daily round.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was fortunate enough to get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had composed himself for sleep that night, and was just dropping\n",
      "comfortably off, when from the other side of the door he heard the\n",
      "sound of angry voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was enough to arouse him. On the previous night silence had reigned.\n",
      "Evidently something out of the ordinary was taking place.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened intently and distinguished words.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who was it I did see thee coming down the road with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who was it thou didst see me coming down the road with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aye, who was it I did see thee coming down the road with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who dost thou think thou art?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who do I think that I am?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aye, who dost thou think thou art?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine could make nothing of it. As a matter of fact, he was hearing\n",
      "the first genuine cross-talk that had ever occurred in those dim,\n",
      "pre-music-hall days. In years to come dialogue on these lines was to\n",
      "be popular throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain. But\n",
      "till then it had been unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voices grew angrier. To an initiated listener it would have been\n",
      "plain that in a short while words would be found inadequate and the\n",
      "dagger, that medieval forerunner of the slap-stick, brought into play.\n",
      "But to Agravaine, all inexperienced, it came as a surprise when\n",
      "suddenly with a muffled thud two bodies fell against the door. There\n",
      "was a scuffling noise, some groans, and then silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then with amazement he heard the bolt shoot back and a key grate in\n",
      "the keyhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door swung open. It was dark outside, but Agravaine could\n",
      "distinguish a female form, and, beyond, a shapeless mass which he took\n",
      "correctly to be the remains of the two plug-uglies.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is I, Yvonne,' said a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it? What has been happening?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was I. I set them against each other. They both loved one of the\n",
      "kitchen-maids. I made them jealous. I told Walt privily that she had\n",
      "favoured Dickon, and Dickon privily that she loved Walt. And now--'\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced at the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No wedding-bells for her,' he said, reverently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And I don't care. I did it to save you. But come! We are wasting time.\n",
      "Come! I will help you to escape.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A man who has been shut up for two days in a small room is seldom slow\n",
      "off the mark when a chance presents itself of taking exercise.\n",
      "Agravaine followed without a word, and together they crept down the\n",
      "dark staircase until they had reached the main hall. From somewhere in\n",
      "the distance came the rhythmic snores of scurvy knaves getting their\n",
      "eight hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Softly Yvonne unbolted a small door, and, passing through it, Agravaine\n",
      "found himself looking up at the stars, while the great walls of the\n",
      "castle towered above him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good-bye,' said Yvonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause. For the first time Agravaine found himself\n",
      "examining the exact position of affairs. After his sojourn in the\n",
      "guarded room, freedom looked very good to him. But freedom meant\n",
      "parting from Yvonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the sky and he looked at the castle walls, and he took a\n",
      "step back towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm not so sure I want to go,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, fly! Fly, Sir Knight!' she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You don't understand,' said Agravaine. 'I don't want to seem to be\n",
      "saying anything that might be interpreted as in the least derogatory to\n",
      "your father in any way whatever, but without prejudice, surely he is\n",
      "just a plain, ordinary brigand? I mean it's only a question of a\n",
      "ransom? And I don't in the least object--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, no, no.' Her voice trembled. 'He would ask no ransom.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't tell me he kidnaps people just as a hobby!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You don't understand. He--No, I cannot tell you. Fly!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What don't I understand?'\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent. Then she began to speak rapidly. 'Very well. I will\n",
      "tell you. Listen. My father had six children, all daughters. We were\n",
      "poor. We had to stay buried in this out-of-the-way spot. We saw no one.\n",
      "It seemed impossible that any of us should ever marry. My father was in\n",
      "despair. Then he said, \"If we cannot get to town, the town must come to\n",
      "us.\" So he sent my sister Yseult to Camelot to ask the king to let us\n",
      "have a knight to protect us against a giant with three heads. There was\n",
      "no giant, but she got the knight. It was Sir Sagramore. Perhaps you\n",
      "knew him?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Agravaine nodded. He began to see daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My sister Yseult was very beautiful. After the first day Sir Sagramore\n",
      "forgot all about the giant, and seemed to want to do nothing else\n",
      "except have Yseult show him how to play cat's cradle. They were married\n",
      "two months later, and my father sent my sister Elaine to Camelot to\n",
      "ask for a knight to protect us against a wild unicorn.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And who bit?' asked Agravaine, deeply interested.\n",

      "Agravaine was conscious of a dull, heavy weight pressing on his heart.\n",
      "He had known his love was hopeless, but even hopelessness is the better\n",
      "for being indefinite. He understood now.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And you naturally want to get rid of me before it can happen,' he\n",
      "said. 'I don't wonder. I'm not vain... Well, I'll go. I knew I had no\n",
      "chance. Good-bye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned. She stopped him with a sharp cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you mean? You cannot wish to stay now? I am saving you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Saving me! I have loved you since the moment you entered the Hall at\n",
      "Camelot,' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew in her breath.\n",
      "\n",

      "She drooped towards him, and he gathered her into his arms. For a\n",

      "\n",
      "It was about six months later that Agravaine, having ridden into the\n",
      "forest, called upon a Wise Man at his cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In those days almost anyone who was not a perfect bonehead could set up\n",
      "as a Wise Man and get away with it. All you had to do was to live in a\n",
      "forest and grow a white beard. This particular Wise Man, for a wonder,\n",
      "had a certain amount of rude sagacity. He listened carefully to what\n",
      "the knight had to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It has puzzled me to such an extent,' said Agravaine, 'that I felt\n",
      "that I must consult a specialist. You see me. Take a good look at me.\n",
      "What do you think of my personal appearance? You needn't hesitate. It's\n",
      "worse than that. I am the ugliest man in England.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you go as far as that?' said the Wise Man, politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Farther. And everybody else thinks so. Everybody except my wife. She\n",
      "tells me that I am a model of manly beauty. You know Lancelot? Well,\n",
      "she says I have Lancelot whipped to a custard. What do you make of\n",
      "that? And here's another thing. It is perfectly obvious to me that my\n",
      "wife is one of the most beautiful creatures in existence. I have seen\n",
      "them all, and I tell you that she stands alone. She is literally\n",
      "marooned in Class A, all by herself. Yet she insists that she is plain.\n",
      "What do you make of it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wise Man stroked his beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My son,' he said, 'the matter is simple. True love takes no account of\n",
      "looks.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No?' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You two are affinities. Therefore, to you the outward aspect is nothing.\n",
      "Put it like this. Love is a thingummybob who what-d'you-call-its.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm beginning to see,' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I meant was this. Love is a wizard greater than Merlin. He plays\n",
      "odd tricks with the eyesight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Agravaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Or, put it another way. Love is a sculptor greater than Praxiteles. He\n",
      "takes an unsightly piece of clay and moulds it into a thing divine.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I get you,' said Agravaine.\n",

      "moment let him go as a multi-millionaire City man and Radical\n",
      "politician. Not that it is satisfactory; it is too mild. The Radical\n",
      "politics of other Radical politicians were as skim-milk to the Radical\n",
      "politics of Radical Politician Rackstraw. Where Mr Lloyd George\n",
      "referred to the House of Lords as blithering backwoodsmen and asinine\n",
      "anachronisms, Mr Rackstraw scorned to be so guarded in his speech. He\n",
      "did not mince his words. His attitude towards a member of the peerage\n",
      "was that of the terrier to the perambulating cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at a charity bazaar that Isabel and Clarence first met. Isabel\n",
      "was presiding over the Billiken, Teddy-bear, and Fancy Goods stall.\n",
      "There she stood, that slim, radiant girl, bouncing Ardent Youth out of\n",
      "its father's hard--earned with a smile that alone was nearly worth the\n",
      "money, when she observed, approaching, the handsomest man she had ever\n",
      "seen. It was--this is not one of those mystery stories--it was\n",
      "Clarence Tresillian. Over the heads of the bevy of gilded youths who\n",
      "clustered round the stall their eyes met. A thrill ran through Isabel.\n",
      "She dropped her eyes. The next moment Clarence had made his spring; the\n",
      "gilded youths had shredded away like a mist, and he was leaning towards\n",
      "her, opening negotiations for the purchase of a yellow Teddy-bear at\n",
      "sixteen times its face value.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned at intervals during the afternoon. Over the second Teddy-bear\n",
      "they became friendly, over the third intimate. He proposed as she was\n",
      "wrapping up the fourth golliwog, and she gave him her heart and the\n",
      "parcel simultaneously. At six o'clock, carrying four Teddy-bears, seven\n",
      "photograph frames, five golliwogs, and a billiken, Clarence went home\n",
      "to tell the news to his parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence, when not at the University, lived with his father and mother\n",
      "in Belgrave Square. His mother had been a Miss Trotter, of Chicago, and\n",
      "it was on her dowry that the Runnymedes contrived to make both ends\n",
      "meet. For a noble family they were in somewhat straitened circumstances\n",
      "financially. They lived, simply and without envy of their rich\n",
      "fellow-citizens, on their hundred thousand pounds a year. They asked no\n",
      "more. It enabled them to entertain on a modest scale. Clarence had been\n",
      "able to go to Oxford; his elder brother, Lord Staines, into the Guards.\n",
      "The girls could buy an occasional new frock. On the whole, they were a\n",
      "thoroughly happy, contented English family of the best sort. Mr Trotter,\n",
      "it is true, was something of a drawback. He was a rugged old tainted\n",
      "millionaire of the old school, with a fondness for shirt-sleeves and a\n",
      "tendency to give undue publicity to toothpicks. But he had been made to\n",
      "understand at an early date that the dead-line for him was the farther\n",
      "shore of the Atlantic Ocean, and he now gave little trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having dressed for dinner, Clarence proceeded to the library, where he\n",
      "found his mother in hysterics and his father in a state of collapse on\n",
      "the sofa. Clarence was too well-bred to make any comment. A true\n",
      "Runnymede, he affected to notice nothing, and, picking up the evening\n",
      "paper, began to read. The announcement of his engagement could be\n",
      "postponed to a more suitable time.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Clarence!' whispered a voice from the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, father?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Where did you see it last?' asked Clarence, ever practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's that fellow Rackstraw!' cried the old man, in feeble rage. 'That\n",
      "bounder Rackstraw! He's the man behind it all. The robber!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Clarence!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his mother who spoke. Her voice seemed to rip the air into a\n",
      "million shreds and stamp on them. There are few things more terrible\n",
      "than a Chicago voice raised in excitement or anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mother?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Never mind your pop and his old veto. He didn't know he had one till\n",
      "the paper said he'd lost it. You listen to me. Clarence, we are\n",
      "ruined.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence looked at her inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ruined much?' he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bed-rock,' said his mother. 'If we have sixty thousand dollars a year\n",
      "after this, it's all we shall have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A low howl escaped from the stricken old man on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence betrayed no emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah,' he said, calmly. 'How did it happen?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've just had a cable from Chicago, from your grand-pop. He's been\n",
      "trying to corner wheat. He always was an impulsive old gazook.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But surely,' said Clarence, a dim recollection of something he had\n",
      "heard or read somewhere coming to him, 'isn't cornering wheat a rather\n",
      "profitable process?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure,' said his mother. 'Sure it is. I guess dad's try at cornering\n",
      "wheat was about the most profitable thing that ever happened--to the\n",
      "other fellows. It seems like they got busy and clubbed fifty-seven\n",
      "varieties of Hades out of your old grand-pop. He's got to give up a lot\n",
      "of his expensive habits, and one of them is sending money to us. That's\n",
      "how it is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And on top of that, mind you,' moaned Lord Runnymede, 'I lose my\n",
      "little veto. It's bitter--bitter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence lit a cigarette and drew at it thoughtfully. 'I don't see how\n",
      "we're going to manage on twelve thousand quid a year,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother crisply revised his pronouns.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We aren't,' she said. 'You've got to get out and hustle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence looked at her blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Work?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Work.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence drew a deep breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Work? Well, of course, mind you, fellows _do_ work,' he went on,\n",
      "thoughtfully. 'I was lunching with a man at the Bachelor's only\n",
      "yesterday who swore he knew a fellow who had met a man whose cousin\n",
      "worked. But I don't see what I could do, don't you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His father raised himself on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Haven't I given you the education of an English gentleman?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's the difficulty,' said Clarence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can't you do _anything_?' asked his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I can play footer. By Jove, I'll sign on as a pro. I'll take a\n",
      "new name. I'll call myself Jones. I can get signed on in a minute. Any\n",
      "club will jump at me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was no idle boast. Since early childhood Clarence had concentrated\n",
      "his energies on becoming a footballer, and was now an exceedingly fine\n",
      "goal-keeper. It was a pleasing sight to see him, poised on one foot in\n",
      "the attitude of a Salome dancer, with one eye on the man with the ball,\n",
      "the other gazing coldly on the rest of the opposition forward line,\n",
      "uncurl abruptly like the main-spring of a watch and stop a hot one.\n",
      "Clarence in goal was the nearest approach to an india-rubber acrobat\n",
      "and society contortionist to be seen off the music-hall stage. He was,\n",
      "in brief, hot stuff. He had the goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely had he uttered these momentous words when the butler entered\n",
      "with the announcement that he was wanted by a lady on the telephone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Isabel, disturbed and fearful.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, Clarence,' she cried, 'my precious angel wonder-child, I don't\n",
      "know how to begin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Begin just like that,' said Clarence, approvingly. 'It's topping. You\n",
      "can't beat it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Clarence, a terrible thing has happened. I told papa of our\n",
      "engagement, and he wouldn't hear of it. He c-called you a a p-p-p--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A pr-pr-pr--'\n",

      "'He's wrong. I'm nothing of the sort. He must be thinking of someone\n",
      "else.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A preposterous excrescence on the social cosmos. He doesn't like your\n",
      "father being an earl.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A man may be an earl and still a gentleman,' said Clarence, not\n",
      "without a touch of coldness in his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I forgot to tell him that. But I don't think it would make any\n",
      "difference. He says I shall only marry a man who works.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am going to work, dearest,' said Clarence. 'I am going to work like a\n",
      "horse. Something--I know not what--tells me I shall be rather good at\n",
      "work. And one day when I--'\n",

      "\n",
      "Clarence, as he had predicted, found no difficulty in obtaining\n",
      "employment. He was signed on at once, under the name of Jones, by\n",
      "Houndsditch Wednesday, the premier metropolitan club, and embarked at\n",
      "once on his new career.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season during which Clarence Tresillian kept goal for Houndsditch\n",
      "Wednesday is destined to live long in the memory of followers of\n",
      "professional football. Probably never in the history of the game has\n",
      "there been such persistent and widespread mortality among the more\n",
      "distant relatives of office-boys and junior clerks. Statisticians have\n",
      "estimated that if all the grandmothers alone who perished between the\n",
      "months of September and April that season could have been placed end to\n",
      "end, they would have reached from Hyde Park Corner to the outskirts of\n",
      "Manchester. And it was Clarence who was responsible for this\n",
      "holocaust. Previous to the opening of the season sceptics had shaken\n",
      "their heads over the Wednesday's chances in the First League. Other\n",
      "clubs had bought up the best men in the market, leaving only a mixed\n",
      "assortment of inferior Scotsmen, Irishmen, and Northcountrymen to\n",
      "uphold the honour of the London club.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, like a meteor, Clarence Tresillian had flashed upon the world\n",
      "of football. In the opening game he had behaved in the goal-mouth like\n",
      "a Chinese cracker, and exhibited an absolutely impassable defence; and\n",
      "from then onward, except for an occasional check, Houndsditch Wednesday\n",
      "had never looked back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the spectators who flocked to the Houndsditch ground to watch\n",
      "Clarence perform there appeared week after week a little, grey, dried-up\n",
      "man, insignificant except for a certain happy choice of language in\n",
      "moments of emotion and an enthusiasm far surpassing that of the\n",
      "ordinary spectator. To the trained eye there are subtle distinctions\n",
      "between football enthusiasts. This man belonged to the comparatively\n",
      "small class of those who have football on the cerebrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fate had made Daniel Rackstraw a millionaire and a Radical, but at\n",
      "heart he was a spectator of football. He never missed a match. His\n",
      "library of football literature was the finest in the country. His\n",
      "football museum had but one equal, that of Mr Jacob Dodson, of\n",
      "Manchester. Between them the two had cornered, at enormous expense, the\n",
      "curio market of the game. It was Rackstraw who had secured the\n",
      "authentic pair of boots in which Bloomer had first played for England;\n",
      "but it was Dodson who possessed the painted india-rubber ball used by\n",
      "Meredith when a boy--probably the first thing except a nurse ever\n",
      "kicked by that talented foot. The two men were friends, as far as rival\n",
      "connoisseurs can be friends; and Mr Dodson, when at leisure, would\n",
      "frequently pay a visit to Mr Rackstraw's country house, where he would\n",
      "spend hours gazing wistfully at the Bloomer boots, buoyed up only by\n",
      "the thoughts of the Meredith ball at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabel saw little of Clarence during the winter months, except from a\n",
      "distance. She contented herself with clipping photographs of him from\n",
      "the sporting papers. Each was a little more unlike him than the last,\n",
      "and this lent variety to the collection. Her father marked her new-born\n",
      "enthusiasm for the game with approval. It had been secretly a great\n",
      "grief to the old gentleman that his only child did not know the\n",
      "difference between a linesman and an inside right, and, more, did not\n",
      "seem to care to know. He felt himself drawn closer to her. An\n",
      "understanding, as pleasant as it was new and strange, began to spring\n",
      "up between parent and child.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Clarence, how easy it would be to haul up one's slacks to\n",
      "practically an unlimited extent on the subject of his emotions at this\n",
      "time. One can figure him, after the game is over and the gay throng has\n",
      "dispersed, creeping moodily--but what's the use? Brevity--that is the\n",
      "cry. Brevity. Let us on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The months sped by; the Cup-ties began, and soon it was evident that\n",
      "the Final must be fought out between Houndsditch Wednesday and Mr Jacob\n",
      "Dodson's pet team, Manchester United. With each match the Wednesday\n",
      "seemed to improve. Clarence was a Gibraltar among goal-keepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were delirious days for Daniel Rackstraw. Long before the fourth\n",
      "round his voice had dwindled to a husky whisper. Deep lines appeared on\n",
      "his forehead; for it is an awful thing for a football enthusiast to be\n",
      "compelled to applaud, in the very middle of the Cup-ties, purely by\n",
      "means of facial expression. In this time of affliction he found Isabel\n",
      "an ever-increasing comfort to him. Side by side they would sit, and the\n",
      "old man's face would lose its drawn look, and light up, as her clear\n",
      "young soprano pealed out over the din, urging this player to shoot,\n",
      "that to kick some opponent in the face; or describing the referee in no\n",
      "uncertain terms as a reincarnation of the late Mr Dick Turpin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the day of the Final at the Crystal Palace approached, and all\n",
      "England was alert, confident of a record-breaking contest. But alas!\n",
      "How truly does Epictetus observe: 'We know not what awaiteth us round\n",
      "the corner, and the hand that counteth its chickens ere they be hatched\n",
      "oft-times doth but step on the banana-skin.' The prophets who\n",
      "anticipated a struggle keener than any in football history were\n",
      "destined to be proved false.\n",

      "It was not that their judgement of form was at fault. On the run of the\n",

      "have been the two most evenly-matched teams in the history of the game.\n",
      "Forward, the latter held a slight superiority; but this was balanced by\n",
      "the inspired goal-keeping of Clarence Tresillian. Even the keenest\n",

      "careful study of the work of both teams, was that Houndsditch Wednesday\n",
      "had rather less chance in the forthcoming tourney than a stuffed rat in\n",

      "Houndsditch Wednesday might, with an effort (conceding them that slice\n",
      "of luck which so often turns the tide of a game), scrape home. But when\n",
      "it was a question of meeting a team like Manchester United--here Mr\n",
      "Dodson, shrugging his shoulders despairingly, sank back in his chair,\n",
      "and watchful secretaries brought him round with oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the whole country nothing but the approaching match was\n",
      "discussed. Wherever civilization reigned, and in portions of Liverpool,\n",
      "one question alone was on every lip: Who would win? Octogenarians\n",
      "mumbled it. Infants lisped it. Tired City men, trampled under foot in\n",

      "carried them to the hospital.\n",

      "for nearly two hours the sweat of agony trickled unceasingly down the\n",
      "corrugated foreheads of the patriots in the stands. The men from\n",
      "Manchester, freed from the fear of Clarence, smiled grim smiles and\n",
      "proceeded to pile up points. It was in vain that the Houndsditch backs\n",

      "'Very well,' said Mr Rackstraw. 'Then let's get it fixed up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, it is but a dog's life, that of the short-story writer. I\n",
      "particularly wished at this point to introduce a description of Mr\n",
      "Rackstraw's country house and estate, featuring the private football\n",
      "ground with its fringe of noble trees. It would have served a double\n",
      "purpose, not only charming the lover of nature, but acting as a fine\n",
      "stimulus to the youth of the country, showing them the sort of home\n",
      "they would be able to buy some day if they worked hard and saved their\n",
      "money. But no. You shall have three guesses as to what was the cry. You\n",

      "their breath, their murmured endearments. I could, mind you. It is at\n",
      "just such descriptions that I am particularly happy. But I have grown\n",

      "In Alcala, as in most of New York's apartment houses, the schedule of\n",
      "prices is like a badly rolled cigarette--thick in the middle and thin\n",
      "at both ends. The rooms half-way up are expensive; some of them almost\n",

      "Cheapest of all was the hall-bedroom. Its furniture was of the\n",
      "simplest. It consisted of a chair, another chair, a worn carpet, and a\n",
      "folding-bed. The folding-bed had an air of depression and baffled\n",
      "hopes. For years it had been trying to look like a bookcase in the\n",
      "daytime, and now it looked more like a folding-bed than ever. There\n",
      "was also a plain deal table, much stained with ink. At this, night\n",
      "after night, sometimes far into the morning, Rutherford Maxwell would\n",
      "sit and write stories. Now and then it happened that one would be a\n",
      "good story, and find a market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rutherford Maxwell was an Englishman, and the younger son of an\n",
      "Englishman; and his lot was the lot of the younger sons all the world\n",
      "over. He was by profession one of the numerous employees of the New\n",
      "Asiatic Bank, which has its branches all over the world. It is a sound,\n",
      "trustworthy institution, and steady-going relatives would assure\n",
      "Rutherford that he was lucky to have got a berth in it. Rutherford did\n",
      "not agree with them. However sound and trustworthy, it was not exactly\n",
      "romantic. Nor did it err on the side of over-lavishness to those who\n",
      "served it. Rutherford's salary was small. So were his prospects--if he\n",
      "remained in the bank. At a very early date he had registered a vow that\n",
      "he would not. And the road that led out of it for him was the uphill\n",
      "road of literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thankful for small mercies. Fate had not been over-kind up to\n",
      "the present, but at least she had dispatched him to New York, the\n",
      "centre of things, where he would have the chance to try, instead of to\n",
      "some spot off the map. Whether he won or lost, at any rate he was in\n",
      "the ring, and could fight. So every night he sat in Alcala, and wrote.\n",
      "Sometimes he would only try to write, and that was torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is never an hour of the day or night when Alcala is wholly\n",
      "asleep. The middle of the house is a sort of chorus-girl belt, while in\n",
      "the upper rooms there are reporters and other nightbirds. Long after he\n",
      "had gone to bed, Rutherford would hear footsteps passing his door and\n",
      "the sound of voices in the passage. He grew to welcome them. They\n",
      "seemed to connect him with the outer world. But for them he was alone\n",
      "after he had left the office, utterly alone, as it is possible to be\n",
      "only in the heart of a great city. Some nights he would hear scraps of\n",
      "conversations, at rare intervals a name. He used to build up in his\n",
      "mind identities for the owners of the names. One in particular, Peggy,\n",
      "gave him much food for thought. He pictured her as bright and\n",
      "vivacious. This was because she sang sometimes as she passed his door.\n",
      "She had been singing when he first heard her name. 'Oh, cut it out,\n",

      "possible to think, and worked out almost mechanically, had been\n",
      "accepted by a magazine of a higher standing than those which hitherto\n",
      "had shown him hospitality. He began to dream of a holiday in the woods.\n",
      "The holiday spirit was abroad. Alcala was emptying itself. It would not\n",
      "be long before he too would be able to get away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so deep in his thoughts that at first he did not hear the\n",
      "knocking at the door. But it was a sharp, insistent knocking, and\n",
      "forced itself upon his attention. He got up and turned the handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside in the passage was standing a girl, tall and sleepy-eyed. She\n",
      "wore a picture-hat and a costume the keynote of which was a certain\n",
      "aggressive attractiveness. There was no room for doubt as to which\n",
      "particular brand of scent was her favourite at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gazed at Rutherford dully. Like Banquo's ghost, she had no\n",

      "conscious of his shirt-sleeves.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "The intellectual pressure of the conversation was beginning to be a\n",
      "little too much for Rutherford. Combined with the heat of the night it\n",
      "made his head swim.\n",
      "\n",
      "His visitor advanced into the room. Arriving at the table, she began\n",
      "fiddling with its contents. The pen seemed to fascinate her. She picked\n",
      "it up and inspected it closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Say, what d'you call this?' she said.\n",
      "\n",

      "'Oh!' A pause. 'Say, got a cigarette?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Rutherford clutched a chair with one hand, and his forehead with the\n",

      "\n",
      "At this moment Rescue arrived, not before it was needed. A brisk sound\n",
      "of footsteps in the passage, and there appeared in the doorway a second\n",
      "girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you think you're doing, Gladys?' demanded the new-comer. 'You\n",

      "the picture-hat was small and well-shaped, the nose delicately\n",
      "tip-tilted, the chin determined, the mouth a little wide and suggesting\n",

      "Things were not running well for Rutherford. He had had his vacation, a\n",
      "golden fortnight of fresh air and sunshine in the Catskills, and was\n",
      "back in Alcala, trying with poor success, to pick up the threads of his\n",
      "work. But though the Indian Summer had begun, and there was energy in\n",
      "the air, night after night he sat idle in his room; night after night\n",
      "went wearily to bed, oppressed with a dull sense of failure. He could\n",
      "not work. He was restless. His thoughts would not concentrate\n",
      "themselves. Something was wrong; and he knew what it was, though he\n",
      "fought against admitting it to himself. It was the absence of Peggy\n",
      "that had brought about the change. Not till now had he realized to the\n",
      "full how greatly her visits had stimulated him. He had called her\n",
      "laughingly his mascot; but the thing was no joke. It was true. Her\n",
      "absence was robbing him of the power to write.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was lonely. For the first time since he had come to New York he was\n",
      "really lonely. Solitude had not hurt him till now. In his black moments\n",
      "it had been enough for him to look up at the photograph on the\n",
      "mantelpiece, and instantly he was alone no longer. But now the\n",
      "photograph had lost its magic. It could not hold him. Always his mind\n",
      "would wander back to the little, black-haired ghost that sat on the\n",
      "table, smiling at him, and questioning him with its grey eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the days went by, unvarying in their monotony. And always the ghost\n",
      "sat on the table, smiling at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Fall came the reopening of the theatres. One by one the\n",
      "electric signs blazed out along Broadway, spreading the message that\n",
      "the dull days were over, and New York was itself again. At the Melody,\n",
      "where ages ago _The Island of Girls_ had run its light-hearted\n",
      "course, a new musical piece was in rehearsal. Alcala was full once\n",
      "more. The nightly snatches of conversation outside his door had\n",
      "recommenced. He listened for her voice, but he never heard it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat up, waiting, into the small hours, but she did not come. Once he\n",
      "had been trying to write, and had fallen, as usual, to brooding--there\n",
      "was a soft knock at the door. In an instant he had bounded from his\n",
      "chair, and turned the handle. It was one of the reporters from\n",
      "upstairs, who had run out of matches. Rutherford gave him a handful.\n",
      "The reporter went out, wondering what the man had laughed at.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is balm in Broadway, especially by night. Depression vanishes\n",
      "before the cheerfulness of the great white way when the lights are lit\n",

      "habit of patrolling the neighbourhood of Forty-Second Street at\n",
      "theatre-time. He found it did him good. There is a gaiety, a bonhomie,\n",
      "in the atmosphere of the New York streets. Rutherford loved to stand on\n",
      "the sidewalk and watch the passers-by, weaving stories round them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night his wanderings had brought him to Herald Square. The theatres\n",
      "were just emptying themselves. This was the time he liked best. He drew\n",
      "to one side to watch, and as he moved he saw Peggy.\n",
      "\n",

      "upon her paternally. One or two men turned and looked after her as she\n",
      "passed. The waiters smiled slight but friendly smiles. Rutherford,\n",
      "intent on her, noticed none of these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite her protests, he ordered an elaborate and expensive supper. He\n",
      "was particular about the wine. The waiter, who had been doubtful about\n",
      "him, was won over, and went off to execute the order, reflecting that\n",
      "it was never safe to judge a man by his clothes, and that Rutherford\n",
      "was probably one of these eccentric young millionaires who didn't care\n",

      "drawing infinitesimal salaries in banks, even if those salaries are\n",
      "supplemented at rare intervals by a short story in a magazine. Peggy\n",
      "was for returning to Alcala by car, but Rutherford refused to\n",
      "countenance such an anti-climax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peggy nestled into the corner of the cab, with a tired sigh, and there\n",
      "was silence as they moved smoothly up Broadway.\n",
      "\n",
      "He peered at her in the dim light. She looked very small and wistful\n",
      "and fragile. Suddenly an intense desire surged over him to pick her up\n",
      "and crush her to him. He fought against it. He tried to fix his\n",
      "thoughts on the girl at home, to tell himself that he was a man of\n",
      "honour. His fingers, gripping the edge of the seat, tightened till\n",
      "every muscle of his arm was rigid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cab, crossing a rough piece of road, jolted Peggy from her corner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Her grey eyes were wet. He could see them glisten. And then his arms\n",
      "were round her, and he was covering her upturned face with kisses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cab drew up at the entrance to Alcala. They alighted in silence,\n",
      "and without a word made their way through into the hall. From force of\n",
      "habit, Rutherford glanced at the letter-rack on the wall at the foot of\n",
      "the stairs. There was one letter in his pigeon-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mechanically he drew it out; and, as his eyes fell on the handwriting,\n",
      "something seemed to snap inside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at Peggy, standing on the bottom stair, and back again at the\n",
      "envelope in his hand. His mood was changing with a violence that left\n",
      "him physically weak. He felt dazed, as if he had wakened out of a\n",
      "trance.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a strong effort he mastered himself. Peggy had mounted a few\n",
      "steps, and was looking back at him over her shoulder. He could read the\n",
      "meaning now in the grey eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good night, Peggy,' he said in a low voice. She turned, facing him,\n",
      "and for a moment neither moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good night!' said Rutherford again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her lips parted, as if she were about to speak, but she said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she turned again, and began to walk slowly upstairs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Peggy's nightly visits began afresh after this, and the ghost on the\n",
      "table troubled Rutherford no more. His restlessness left him. He began\n",
      "to write with a new vigour and success. In after years he wrote many\n",
      "plays, most of them good, clear-cut pieces of work, but none that came\n",
      "from him with the utter absence of labour which made the writing of\n",
      "_Willie in the Wilderness_ a joy. He wrote easily, without effort.\n",
      "And always Peggy was there, helping, stimulating, encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, when he came in after dinner to settle down to work, he\n",
      "would find a piece of paper on his table covered with her schoolgirl\n",
      "scrawl. It would run somewhat as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "'He is proud of his arms. They are skinny, but he thinks them the\n",
      "limit. Better put in a shirt-sleeve scene for Willie somewhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He thinks he has a beautiful profile. Couldn't you make one of the\n",

      "\n",
      "'He is crazy about golf.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He is proud of his French accent. Couldn't you make Willie speak a\n",
      "little piece in French?'\n",

      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, little by little, the character of Willie grew, till it ceased\n",
      "to be the Willie of the magazine story, and became Winfield Knight\n",
      "himself, with improvements. The task began to fascinate Rutherford. It\n",
      "was like planning a pleasant surprise for a child. 'He'll like that,'\n",
      "he would say to himself, as he wrote in some speech enabling Willie to\n",
      "display one of the accomplishments, real or imagined, of the absent\n",
      "actor. Peggy read it, and approved. It was she who suggested the big\n",
      "speech in the second act where Willie described the progress of his\n",
      "love affair in terms of the golf-links. From her, too, came information\n",
      "as to little traits in the man's character which the stranger would not\n",
      "have suspected.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the play progressed Rutherford was amazed at the completeness of the\n",
      "character he had built. It lived. Willie in the magazine story might\n",
      "have been anyone. He fitted into the story, but you could not see him.\n",
      "He had no real individuality. But Willie in the play! He felt that he\n",
      "would recognize him in the street. There was all the difference between\n",
      "the two that there is between a nameless figure in some cheap picture\n",
      "and a portrait by Sargent. There were times when the story of the play\n",
      "seemed thin to him, and the other characters wooden, but in his\n",
      "blackest moods he was sure of Willie. All the contradictions in the\n",
      "character rang true: the humour, the pathos, the surface vanity\n",
      "covering a real diffidence, the strength and weakness fighting one\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're alive, my son,' said Rutherford, admiringly, as he read the\n",
      "sheets. 'But you don't belong to me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "At last there came the day when the play was finished, when the last\n",
      "line was written, and the last possible alteration made; and later, the\n",
      "day when Rutherford, bearing the brown-paper-covered package under his\n",
      "arm, called at the Players' Club to keep an appointment with Winfield\n",
      "Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost from the first Rutherford had a feeling that he had met the man\n",
      "before, that he knew him. As their acquaintance progressed--the actor\n",
      "was in an expansive mood, and talked much before coming to business--the\n",
      "feeling grew. Then he understood. This was Willie, and no other. The\n",
      "likeness was extraordinary. Little turns of thought, little\n",
      "expressions--they were all in the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actor paused in a description of how he had almost beaten a\n",
      "champion at golf, and looked at the parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that the play?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Rutherford. 'Shall I read it?'\n",

      "Have a cigar while you're waiting?'\n",

      "Rutherford settled himself in his chair, and watched the other's face.\n",
      "For the first few pages, which contained some tame dialogue between\n",
      "minor characters, it was blank.\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Enter Willie,\"' he said. 'Am I Willie?'\n",

      "\n",
      "He went on reading. Rutherford watched him with furtive keenness. There\n",
      "was a line coming at the bottom of the page which he was then reading\n",
      "which ought to hit him, an epigram on golf, a whimsical thought put\n",
      "almost exactly as he had put it himself five minutes back when telling\n",
      "his golf story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shot did not miss fire. The chuckle from the actor and the sigh of\n",
      "relief from Rutherford were almost simultaneous. Winfield Knight turned\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's a dandy line about golf,' said he.\n",

      "'There's lots more of them in the piece,' he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "It's great! Say, what'll you have?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Rutherford leaned back in his chair, his mind in a whirl. He had\n",
      "arrived at last. His struggles were over. He would not admit of the\n",
      "possibility of the play being a failure. He was a made man. He could go\n",
      "where he pleased, and do as he pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave him something of a shock to find how persistently his thoughts\n",

      "Everyone was agreed that he had never had a part that suited him so\n",
      "well. Critics forgave the blunders of the piece for the sake of its\n",
      "principal character. The play was a curiously amateurish thing. It was\n",
      "only later that Rutherford learned craft and caution. When he wrote\n",

      "_Willie in the Wilderness_ was a success. It might, as one critic\n",
      "pointed out, be more of a monologue act for Winfield Knight than a\n",

      "It was late on the opening night when he returned to Alcala. He had\n",
      "tried to get away earlier. He wanted to see Peggy. But Winfield Knight,\n",
      "flushed with success, was in his most expansive mood. He seized upon\n",
      "Rutherford and would not let him go. There was supper, a gay,\n",
      "uproarious supper, at which everybody seemed to be congratulating\n",
      "everybody else. Men he had never met before shook him warmly by the\n",
      "hand. Somebody made a speech, despite the efforts of the rest of the\n",
