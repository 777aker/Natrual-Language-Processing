Day 1, Dear Diary
Someone tripped on the rug
Some people just don’t swipe at all
Long awkward pause where youre just standing there stairing at it and holding your card, don’t instantly put your card away
Sometimes double swipe
Stare at it waiting for feedback
Walk as they stare sideways at it, walk as wait for it to open
Not fluid
People at the desk never look up
Some of them try to walk through it
Solid green, turns red when you swipe, sometimes just turns off
Only one of them opened for him
Study space, everyone is at a seperate table
Sound is really delayed
If it doesn’t work there is no feedback, sometimes light turns red and doesn’t open
Light turns off and people go to swipe again
Light is off while the card is swiping but once it exits the light is back on
Red still gets you in
There is a difference between when the light is green and when there is a sound
Sometimes makes a weird noise that sounds like it didn’t work but opens
The top looks like a tapper and some people try to tap
The really weird noise people stop and are like dang it no work, but it did, one guy even turned around and started to walk away, looked back and saw it was open
Swipe multiple times
People discouraged from using them
The noise is extremely generic
The labels are super generic
People kick the rugs, rugs seem haphazardly strewn about and don’t make since
Also, they aren’t consistent so what is the point
Don’t talk to people at the desk really
When it doesn’t work its the same thing as when it does
If it doesn’t work then the desk people offer to swipe them
Unused space, to the right just a random plant between the wall and the swipers
Appears as though they made the swipers take up the whole lane in order to encourage people to use
When it doesn’t work they just keep trying, flip it because don’t know which side
They then try a different one and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t
Flip it, flip it back again, didn’t work this way, then this way, then the original way again
Swipe, stand back and look and wonder how it works
Nothing on the tables
Got to reswipe
Tried both ways several times
There’s a charging station with 20 of the exact same plug right in front of a TV and no one uses it, its unclear if it is actually a charging station
The feedback thing is way in the corner and hardly noticeable 
Sometimes people talk but there is a flow
Girl stood on one side of the barrier while talking
